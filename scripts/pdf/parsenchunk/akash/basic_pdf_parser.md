1. PURPOSE AND SCOPE: 
 
1.1. The purpose of this Request for Proposal (“RFP”) is to solicit sealed proposals from qualified 
Offerors to establish one or more Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts for 
Information Technology (“IT”) Staff Augmentation services for Fairfax County , Virginia , and 
Fairfax County Public Schools (“FCPS”). 
 
1.2. This procurement is conducted by Fairfax County Government (“FCG”) and is established as 
a cooperative procurement, allowing other public bodies to participate and utilize the resulting 
contracts. FCG and FCPS intend to award multiple contracts to provide Staff Augmentation  
services. These contracts will offer flexibility to procure services on an as -needed basis 
throughout the contract term; an award does not guarantee work. Tasks orders, Scope of Work 
(“SOW”), request, etc. should be issued intermittent ly based on evolving requirements.  The 
County and participating public bodies reserve the right to complete services among the 
awarded Contractors  at their discretion; however,  they are not required to do so  and may
