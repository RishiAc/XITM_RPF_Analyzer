            set for each job order/position placed, and must ensure the University’s minimum qualifications are met. The University
            will not consider outsourcing recruitment or hiring functions and is not considering “temporary-to-permanent” placement
            arrangements as part of this solicitation. Employees of firms may apply for regular University positions, but will be
            subject to the same competitive application and selection process as other applications. The University will not agree to
            non-compete or non-solicitation clauses.

      i.           Due to the variety of IT needs throughout the organization, the University is looking to contract with IT staffing
                   firms that can accommodate quick recruitment and placement for the following types of roles/areas of support and
                   preferably with experience, background and knowledge working with the University’s Key Applications/Systems
                   (or similar systems) listed below:

            2.     Contractors are required to supply their own computer equipment, but the University has the right to require
                   contractors to use University-supplied equipment. If the use of University-supplied equipment is required, it will be
                   shipped to/from the contractor at the University’s expense. If University-supplied equipment is provided, contractors
                   are required to return the equipment at the end of their contract.

            3.     In order to prevent potential labor law violations, the temporary workers placed at the University shall not
                   simultaneously be active University employees (including student workers). All temporary workers of a successful
                   offeror provide shall be considered your agency’s employees, not the University’s.

            4.     Temporary workers released or rejected by a particular University department for significant violation(s) of
                   University policy (e.g., failure to follow security protocols) cannot be referred for any future assignments at any
                   University location. Failure to meet this criterion shall be considered a breach of contract.

            5.     Successful offerors shall agree that the University may hire your firm’s employees at any time during or after the
                   initial contract term or any extension thereof. The University does not recruit temporary workers for permanent
                   positions or engage in temp-to-hire contracts, but temporary workers are free to apply for open positions at the
                   University on the same terms as any other applicant. This does not preclude firms from having non-compete
                   agreements with their employees but the University will not be a party to or responsible for upholding said non-
                   compete agreement between the firm and their employee.

         may also open the door to additional work with other participating entities. (See CONTRACT PARTICIPATION for more
         details.)

         Contractors shall complete, in Bonfire, the pricing schedule (“Labor Rates (BT-24KX))”. Please provide hourly pricing for any
         and all labor categories and rates associated with IT staff augmentation, consulting, planning, install, implementation,
         development project management, etc. Specifically address the following in your proposal:

          a.  Labor rates should be broken out by the actual hourly rate paid to the employee, firm’s mark-up on the rate, and the fully
              burdened hourly rate to be billed to the University for temp labor and IT consulting services. See Bid Table: BT-24KX.

--- Chunk 17 ---
See Bid Table: BT-24KX.

          b.  Confirm that travel expenses will be reimbursed at cost with no markup and may not exceed Commonwealth of Virginia
              expense guidelines. For consulting, rates must include travel-related expenses if contractor is traveling within a 50-mile
              radius of George Mason's Fairfax campus. If the contractor is traveling from outside a 50-mile radius of the Fairfax
              Campus,   travel will   only be  paid   on a reimbursement basis in        accordance with George Mason's          polices,
              http://fiscal.gmu.edu/travel/, and GSA per diem rates. Additional hourly rates for travel will not be considered. Under no
              circumstances shall Mason make payment or provide reimbursement for any travel fees, including parking for
              temporary workers.

          c.  If different than hourly pricing, describe your pricing structure for consulting engagements, training options and associated
              costs. Include a catalog of training offerings and differentiation between technical staff and end-user training.

          d. Provide a sample invoice for both staff augmentation AND consulting services as part of your offer. Mason has provided
              an Example Invoice as Attachment C – Sample Invoice Format showing an acceptable breakdown for an example project
              for both a consulting and staff augmentation engagement. At a minimum, contractors are required to provide a breakdown
              of the hours worked, the rate, and the total per engagement/project or per day for staff augmentation services.

          e.  For your last five most recent, either ongoing or completed projects (Determined by date of final payment by the customer)
              that exceeded $100k and were billed on an hourly basis, list the following:

                     information to be protected, (b) the section(s)/page number(s) where this information is found in the
                     proposal, and (c) a statement why protection is necessary for each section listed. A statement simply
                     noting “trade secret” is not a sufficient reason for redaction. The firm must also provide a separate
                     attachment of the proposal with the trade secrets and/or proprietary information redacted. If all of these
                     requirements are not met, then the firm’s entire proposal will be available for public inspection.
                     IMPORTANT: A firm may not request that its entire proposal be treated as a trade secret or
                     proprietary information, nor may a firm request that its pricing/fees be treated as a trade secret
                     or proprietary information, or otherwise be deemed confidential. If after given a reasonable time,
                     the Offeror refuses to withdraw the aforementioned designation, the proposal will be rejected.

       3.     Oral Presentation: Offerors who submit a proposal in response to this RFP may be required to give an oral
              presentation/demonstration of their proposal/product to George Mason. This will provide an opportunity for
              the Offeror to clarify or elaborate on their proposal. Performance during oral presentations may affect the
              final award decision. If required, oral presentations will be scheduled at the appropriate time.

              George Mason will expect that the person or persons who will be working on the project to make the
              presentation so experience of the Offeror’s staff can be evaluated prior to making selection. Oral
              presentations are an option of George Mason and may or may not be conducted; therefore, it is imperative
              all proposals should be complete.

B.     SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS: Proposals should be as thorough and detailed as possible to allow George Mason to
       properly evaluate the Offeror’s capabilities and approach toward providing the required services.

               the foregoing, for research collaboration pursuant to subcontracts under sponsored research contracts
               administered by the University's Office of Sponsored Programs, intellectual property rights will be governed

               and received appropriate instruction as to how to comply with the data protection provisions of the Contract
               and to maintain the confidentiality of the University Data.

               under the Contract. The Contract does not give a party any rights, implied or otherwise, to the other party’s
               data, content, or intellectual property, except as expressly stated in the Contract.

        4.     Contractor will take reasonable measures, including audit trails, to protect University Data against

               University Data, per the Virginia Public Records Act, is preserved, maintained, and accessible throughout
               their lifecycle, including converting and migrating electronic data as often as necessary so that information
               is not lost due to hardware, software, or media obsolescence or deterioration.

        5.     Contractor shall notify George Mason within three business days if it receives a request from an individual
               under any applicable law regarding PII about the individual, including but not limited to a request to view,
               access, delete, correct, or amend the information.

        6.     If Contractor will have access to University Data that includes “education records” as defined under the
               Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), the Contractor acknowledges that for the purposes of
               the Contract it will be designated as a “school official” with “legitimate educational interests” in the
               University education records, as those terms have been defined under FERPA and its implementing
               regulations, and the Contractor agrees to abide by the limitations and requirements imposed on school
               officials. Contractor will use the education records only for the purpose of fulfilling its duties under the

        disclosure, alteration, and use. Such measures will be no less protective than those used to secure Contractor’s own
        data of a similar type, and in no event less than reasonable in view of the type and nature of the data involved. At a
        minimum, Contractor shall use industry-standard and up-to-date security tools and technologies such as anti-virus
        protections and intrusion detection methods to protect University Data.

2.     If Contractor provides goods and services that require the exchange of sensitive University Data, the Data
               Security Addendum attached to this Contract provides additional requirements Contractor must take to
               protect the University Data. George Mason reserves the right to determine whether the University Data
               involved in this Contract is sensitive, and if it so determines it will provide the Data Security Addendum to
               Contractor and it will be attached to and incorporated into this contract. Types of University Data that may
               be considered sensitive include, but is not limited to, (1) PII; (2) credit card data; (3) financial or business
               data which has the potential to affect the accuracy of the University’s financial statements; (4) medical or

                 cooperate in the performance of such audits. Contractor will make available to George Mason all information
                 necessary to demonstrate compliance with its data processing obligations. Failure to adequately protect
                 University Data or comply with the terms of this Contract with regard to University Data may be grounds to
                 terminate this Contract.

RR.       UNIVERSITY DATA UPON TERMINATION OR EXPIRATION: Upon termination or expiration of the Contract,
          Contractor will ensure that all University Data are securely returned or destroyed as directed by George Mason in its

          Contractor shall ensure that such transfer/migration uses facilities and methods that are compatible with the relevant
          systems of George Mason or its transferee, and to the extent technologically feasible, that George Mason will have
          reasonable access to University Data during the transition. In the event that George Mason requests destruction of its
          data, Contractor agrees to destroy all data in its possession and in the possession of any subcontractors or agents to
          which the Contractor might have transferred University Data. Contractor agrees to provide documentation of data
          destruction to the University.

          includes immediate transfer of any previously escrowed assets and University Data and providing George Mason
          access to Contractor’s facilities to remove and destroy George Mason-owned assets and University Data. Contractor
          shall implement its exit plan and take all necessary actions to ensure a smooth transition of service with minimal
          disruption to George Mason. Contractor will also provide a full inventory and configuration of servers, routers, other
          hardware, and software involved in service delivery along with supporting documentation, indicating which if any of
          these are owned by or dedicated to George Mason.
