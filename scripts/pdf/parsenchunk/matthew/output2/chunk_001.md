notice, the Contract Manager may direct the removal in a timeframe of less than
fifteen (15) days, including immediate removal.
(4) In circumstances of directed removal, the Successful Offeror shall, provide a

**SECTION V. EVALUATION PROCEDURE**  
**A.** **EVALUATION COMMITTEE**
1. Evaluation of the proposals will be performed by a committee established for the purpose of
analyzing the proposals based on the evaluation criteria set forth below. The Evaluation Committee
will provide input to the Procurement Officer after reviewing proposals, participating in oral
presentations and discussions, and any other activities relative to this RFP.  
2. The AOC reserves the right to utilize the services of individuals outside of the established Evaluation
Committee for advice and assistance, as deemed appropriate by the Procurement Officer.  
**B.** **TECHNICAL PROPOSAL CRITERIA**
The criteria to be applied to each Technical Proposal are listed in descending order of importance. Unless
stated otherwise, any sub-criteria within each criterion have equal weight.  
1. Interview (shortlisted Offeror resources only). Degree to which the proposed resource(s)
demonstrates the skills, experience, and capabilities outlined in Section III.E.;
2. Extent to which the proposed resource(s) resume, education, and narrative demonstrates the
Qualifications, skills, experience, and capabilities outlined in Section III;
3. Extent to which the proposed resource(s) references demonstrate their ability to provide the requested
services outlined in Section III;  
The AOC prefers the Offeror’s Technical Proposal to illustrate a comprehensive understanding of work
requirements and mastery of the subject matter, including an explanation of how the work will be performed.
Technical Proposals which include limited responses to work requirements such as “concur” or “will comply”
sample will receive a lower ranking than Technical Proposals that demonstrate an understanding of the work
requirements and include plans to meet or exceed requirements.  
**C.** **FINANCIAL PROPOSAL CRITERIA**
All Offerors will be ranked from the lowest (most advantageous) to the highest (least advantageous) price
based on their total proposed price set forth in this RFP and as submitted on the Bid/Price Proposal Form
and/or the requested total price.  
**D.** **SELECTION PROCEDURES**
1. The Procurement Officer shall initially review for compliance with the RFP requirements. Failure to
comply with RFP requirements may result in a proposal being classified as not reasonably susceptible
of being selected for award. Minor irregularities in proposals that are immaterial or inconsequential
in nature may be cured or waived whenever it is determined to be in the AOCs best interest.  
2. Selection Procedures:
a. Technical Proposals are evaluated for technical merit and ranked. During this review, oral
presentations, interviews, and discussions may be held. The purpose of such discussions
shall be to assure a full understanding of the AOCs requirements and the Offeror’s ability to
perform, and to facilitate understanding of the Contract that shall be most advantageous to
the AOC.
(1) At the discretion of the Procurement Officer, following the recommendation of the
Evaluation Committee, a shortlist of Offerors may be established during the
technical evaluation. Only shortlisted Offerors would continue in the evaluation
process; Offerors not shortlisted shall be so advised.
(2) Offerors must confirm in writing any substantive oral clarifications of, or changes
in, their Technical Proposal made during discussions. Any such written clarifications
or changes become part of the Offeror’s Technical Proposal.
(3) The AOC may require any Offeror to furnish additional information regarding past
performance, financial capacity, technical expertise, or other qualifications bearing

on the performance of the contract and reserves the right to consider any information
otherwise available, or to make such additional investigations as it deems necessary
to confirm the Offeror is reasonably susceptible of being selected for award.
b. The Financial Proposal of each remaining Offeror will be evaluated and ranked separately
from the technical evaluation. After a review of the Financial Proposals of remaining
Offerors, the Evaluation Committee and/or Procurement Officer may conduct discussions to
further evaluate the Offeror’s entire proposal.
c. When in the best interest of the AOC, the Procurement Officer may permit remaining
Offerors to revise their initial proposals and submit, in writing, Best and Final Offers
(BAFOs). The AOC may make award without issuing a request for a BAFO.  
3. Recommendation for Award
a. Upon completion of the Technical Proposal and Financial Proposal evaluations and rankings,
an overall ranking will be designated to each Offeror.
b. The Procurement Officer will recommend award of the Contract to the Offeror that submitted
the proposal determined to be the most advantageous to the AOC. In making the most
advantageous Offeror’s determination, technical factors shall be given greater weight than
price factors.  
**E.** **DEBRIEFING**
Unsuccessful Offerors may request a debriefing. If the Offeror chooses to do so, the request must be
submitted in writing to the Procurement Officer within fourteen (14) calendar days from the date they are
notified their proposal was unsuccessful. Debriefings shall be limited to discussion of the specific Offeror’s
proposal only and shall not include a discussion of a competing Offeror’s proposal. Debriefings shall be
provided within thirty (30) calendar days of the award notification date.
