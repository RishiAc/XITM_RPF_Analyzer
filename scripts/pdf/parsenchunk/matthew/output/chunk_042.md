read publicly, and made available for inspection as provided in paragraph 64, General Conditions and Instructions to Bidders.

[Tabulations of bids received are posted on the County’s website at: https://www.fairfaxcounty.gov/procurement/bid-tab.](https://www.fairfaxcounty.gov/procurement/bid-tab)  
Proposals received in response to a Request for Proposal (RFP) will be made available as provided in Paragraph 63, General
Conditions and Instructions to Bidders.  
**14. OMISSIONS & DISCREPANCIES** -Any items or parts of any equipment listed in this solicitation that clearly necessary for the  
operation and completion of such equipment, but are: (i) not fully described by the County; or (ii) are omitted by the County from
such specification, shall be considered a part of such equipment even if not directly specified or called for in the specifications.  
If a bidder finds discrepancies or ambiguities in, or omissions from, the solicitation, including the drawings and/or specifications,
it shall notify the Purchasing Agent at least five (5) days prior to the date set for the opening of bids. If necessary, the Purchasing
Agent will send a written addendum for clarification to all bidders no later than three (3) days before the date set for opening of
bids. Notifications regarding specifications will not be considered if received within five days of the date set for opening of bids.  
**15. BIDDER INTERESTED IN MORE THAN ONE BID** -If more than one bid is offered by a bidder, directly or indirectly, all such bids  
may be rejected. A bidder who has quoted prices on work, materials, or supplies to a bidder is not disqualified from quoting
prices to other bidders or firms submitting a bid directly for the work, materials or supplies.  
**16. TAX EXEMPTION** -The County is exempt from the payment of any federal excise or any Virginia sales tax. Fairfax County's  
Federal Excise Tax Exemption Number is 54-74-0127K.  
**17. PROHIBITION AGAINST UNIFORM PRICING** -The Purchasing Agent encourages open and competitive bidding by all possible  
means and endeavors to obtain the maximum degree of open competition on all purchase transactions using the methods of
procurement authorized by the Fairfax County Purchasing Resolution. Each bidder, by virtue of submitting a bid, guarantees
that it has not been a party with other bidders to an agreement to bid a fixed or uniform price. Violation of this implied guarantee
shall render void the bids of participating bidders. Any disclosure to or acquisition by a competitive bidder, in advance of the
opening of the bids, of the terms or conditions of the bid submitted by another competitor may render the entire proceedings void
and may require re-advertising for bids.  
**18. UNBALANCED BIDS—** A Bid shall be mathematically unbalanced if the Bid contains unit pricing that does not reflect reasonable  
25  
RFP 2000004198  
Appendix A
**GENERAL CONDITIONS AND INSTRUCTIONS TO BIDDERS**  
costs (including actual labor and material cost, overhead and profit) for the performance of the bid item(s) in question. A Bid shall
be materially unbalanced if there is a reasonable doubt that award of the mathematically unbalanced Bid will result in the lowest
ultimate cost to the County. A Bid that is, in the sole discretion of the County Purchasing Agent, both mathematically and
materially unbalanced, may be rejected as non-responsive.  
**SPECIFICATIONS**  
**19. CLARIFICATION OF TERMS—** If any prospective bidder has questions about the specifications or other solicitation documents,  
the prospective bidder should contact the contract specialist whose name appears on the face of the solicitation no later than
five working dates before the due date. Any revisions to the solicitation will be made only be addendum issued by the contract
specialist.  
**20. BRAND NAME OR EQUAL ITEMS** -Unless otherwise provided in the Invitation for Bid, the name of a certain brand, make or  
manufacturer does not restrict bidders to the specific brand, make or manufacturer named; it conveys the general style, type,
character, and quality of the article desired. Any article that the County in its sole discretion determines to be the equivalent of
that specified, considering quality, workmanship, economy of operation, and suitability for the purpose intended, shall be
accepted. The bidder is responsible for clearly and specifically identifying the product being offered and providing sufficient
descriptive literature, catalog cuts and technical detail to enable the County to determine if the product offered meets the
requirements of the solicitation. This is required even if offering the exact brand, make, or manufacturer specified. Failure to
furnish adequate data for evaluation purposes may result in declaring a bid nonresponsive. Unless the bidder clearly indicates
in its bid that the product is an equivalent product, such bid will be considered to offer the brand name product referenced in the
solicitation.  
**21. SPECIFICATIONS** -When a solicitation contains a specification that states no substitutes, no deviation therefrom will be permitted  
and the bidder will be required to furnish articles in conformity with that specification.  
The bidder must abide by and comply with the true intent of the specifications and not take advantage of any unintentional error
or omission, but shall fully complete every part as the true intent and meaning of the specifications and drawings. Whenever the
mention is made of any articles, material, or workmanship to be in accordance with laws, ordinances, building codes, underwriter's
codes, A.S.T.M. regulations or similar expressions, the requirements of these laws, ordinances, etc., shall be construed as to the
minimum requirements of these specifications.  
**AWARD**  
**22. AWARD OR REJECTION OF BIDS** -The Purchasing Agent shall award the contract to the lowest responsive and responsible  
bidder complying with all provisions of the IFB, provided the bid price is reasonable and it is in the best interest of the County to
accept it. Awards made in response to a RFP will be made to the highest qualified offeror whose proposal is determined, in
writing, to be the most advantageous to the County taking into consideration the evaluation factors set forth in the RFP. The
Purchasing Agent reserves the right to award a contract by individual items, in the aggregate, or in combination thereof, or to
reject any or all bids and to waive any informality in bids received whenever such rejection or waiver is in the best interest of the
County. Award may be made to as many bidders as deemed necessary to fulfill the anticipated requirements of Fairfax County.
The Purchasing Agent also reserves the right to reject the bid of a bidder deemed to be a non-responsible bidder.  
In determining the responsibility of a bidder, the following criteria will be considered:
a. The ability, capacity and skill of the bidder to perform the contract or provide the service required;
b. Whether the bidder can perform the contract or provide the service promptly, or within the time specified, without delay or  
interference;
c. The character, integrity, reputation, judgment, experience and efficiency of the bidder;
d. The quality of performance of previous contracts or services;
e. The previous and existing compliance by the bidder with laws and ordinances relating to the contract or services;
f. The sufficiency of the financial resources and ability of the bidder to perform the contract or provide the service;
g. The quality, availability and adaptability of the goods or services to the particular use required;
h. The ability of the bidder to provide future maintenance and service for the use of the subject of the contract;
i. Whether the bidder is in arrears to the County on debt or contract or is a defaulter on surety to the County or whether the  
bidder's County taxes or assessments are delinquent; and
j. Such other information as may be secured by the Purchasing Agent having a bearing on the decision to award the contract.  
If an apparent low bidder is not awarded a contract for reasons of non-responsibility, the Purchasing Agent shall so notify that
bidder and shall have recorded the reasons in the contract file.  
**23. NOTICE OF ACCEPTANCE/CONTRACT DOCUMENTS** -A written award (or Acceptance Agreement) mailed or otherwise  
furnished to the successful bidder within the time for acceptance specified in the solicitation shall result in a binding contract.
The following documents, which are included in the solicitation, are incorporated by reference in and made part of the resulting
contract:
a. County of Fairfax Solicitation Form (Cover Sheet) and other documents which may be incorporated by reference, if
applicable
b. Acceptance Agreement
c. General Conditions and Instructions to Bidders

Appendix A
**GENERAL CONDITIONS AND INSTRUCTIONS TO BIDDERS**  
**24. TIE-BIDS** – If all bids are for the same total amount or unit price (including authorized discounts and delivery times), and if the  
public interest will not permit the delay of re-advertisement for bids, the Purchasing Agent is authorized to award the contract to
the tie bidder that has its principal place of business in the County, or if there be none, to the resident Virginia tie bidder, or if
there be none, to one of the tie bidders by drawing lots in public; or the Purchasing Agent may purchase the goods or services
in the open market except that the price paid shall not exceed the lowest contract bid price submitted for the same goods or
services. The decision of the County to make award to one or more such bidders shall be final.  
**25. PROMPT PAYMENT DISCOUNT**  
a. Unless otherwise specified in the solicitation, prompt payment discounts requiring payment in less than fifteen (15) days will
not be considered in evaluating a bid for award. However, even though not considered in the evaluation, such discounts will
be taken if payment is to be made within the discount period.
b. If a discount for prompt payment is allowed, the discount period will begin on the date of receipt of a properly completed
invoice or acceptance of materials or services, whichever is later.
c. For determining acceptance of supplies in accordance with the provisions of the prompt payment discount paragraph,
inspection and acceptance shall be accomplished only after examination (including testing) of supplies and services to
determine whether the supplies and services conform to the contract requirements.  
For the purpose of earning the discount, payment is deemed to be made as of the date of mailing of the County check or issuance
of an Electronic Funds Transfer, or completion of a credit card transaction.  
**26. INSPECTION-ACCEPTANCE** - Acceptance shall occur only after receipt and inspection provided such inspection, as  
appropriate, is accomplished within a reasonable time. The County reserves the right to conduct any test/inspection it may deem
advisable to assure goods and services conform to the specifications.  
**27. DEFINITE BID QUANTITIES** -Where definite quantities are specifically stated, acceptance will bind the County to order quantities  
specified and to pay for, at contract prices, all such supplies or services delivered that meet specifications and conditions of the
contract. However, the County will not be required to accept delivery of any balances unordered, as of the contract expiration
date, unless the Contractor furnished the Purchasing Agent with a statement of unordered balances not later than ten (10) days
after the termination date of the contract.  
**28. REQUIREMENT BID QUANTITIES** -On "Requirement" bids, acceptance will bind the County to pay for, at unit bid prices, only  
quantities ordered and delivered. Where the County specifies estimated quantities, the Contractor shall not be required to deliver
more than ten (10) percent in excess of the estimated quantity of each item, unless otherwise agreed upon.  
**CONTRACT PROVISIONS**  
**29. TERMINATION OF CONTRACTS** -Contracts will remain in force for (i) the full period specified or (ii) until all articles ordered  
before date of termination, but arriving after the termination date, are satisfactorily delivered, accepted, and any further
requirements and conditions are met, unless the Contract is:  
a. Terminated prior to expiration date by satisfactory deliveries of entire contract requirements, or upon termination by the  
County for Convenience or Cause.  
b. Extended upon written authorization of the Purchasing Agent and accepted by Contractor, to permit ordering of unordered  
balances or additional quantities at contract prices and in accordance with contract terms.  
**30. TERMINATION FOR CONVENIENCE**
a. A contract may be terminated in whole or in part by the County in accordance with this clause whenever the Purchasing
Agent determines that such a termination is in the best interest of the County. Any such termination will be effected by
delivery to the Contractor of a Notice of Termination specifying the extent to which performance is terminated and the date
upon which termination becomes effective.
b. An equitable adjustment in the contract price shall be made by the Purchasing Agent for completed service, but no amount
shall be allowed for anticipated profit on unperformed services. Paragraph 30.b shall survive termination of the contract.  
**31. TERMINATION OF CONTRACT FOR CAUSE**  
a. If, through any cause, the Contractor fails to fulfill in a timely and proper manner its obligations under this contract, or if the
Contractor violates any of the covenants, agreements, or stipulations of this contract, the County has the right to terminate
the contract. Any such termination will be effected by delivery to the Contractor of a Notice of Termination specifying the
extent to which performance is terminated and the date upon which termination becomes effective. In such event, all finished
or unfinished documents, data, studies, surveys, drawings, maps, models, and reports prepared by the Contractor under the
contract shall, at the option of the County, become the County’s property and the Contractor shall be entitled to receive just
and equitable compensation for any satisfactory work completed on such documents.  
b. Termination of the Contract for Cause does not relieve the Contractor of liability to the County for damages sustained by the
County by virtue of any breach of contract by the Contractor for the purpose of set off until such time as the exact amount of
damages due to the County from the Contractor is determined.  
**32. CONTRACT ALTERATIONS** -No alterations in the terms of a contract shall be valid or binding upon the County unless made in  
27  
RFP 2000004198  
Appendix A
**GENERAL CONDITIONS AND INSTRUCTIONS TO BIDDERS**  
writing and signed by the Purchasing Agent or her authorized agent.  
**33. SUBLETTING OR ASSIGNMENT** -It is mutually understood and agreed that the Contractor shall not assign, transfer, convey,  
sublet or otherwise dispose of his or her contractual duties to any other person, firm or corporation, without the previous written
consent of the Purchasing Agent. If the Contractor desires to assign its right to payment of the contract, Contractor shall notify
the Purchasing Agent immediately, in writing, of such assignment of right to payment. In no case shall such assignment of
contract relieve the Contractor from its obligations or change the terms of the contract.  
**34. FUNDING** - The obligation of the County to pay compensation due the Contractor under the contract or any other payment  
obligations under any contract awarded pursuant to this contract is subject to appropriations by the Fairfax County Board of
Supervisors to satisfy payment of such obligations. The County’s obligations to make payments during subsequent fiscal years
are dependent upon the same action. If such an appropriation is not made for any fiscal year, the contract shall terminate
effective at the end of the fiscal year for which funds were appropriated and the County will not be obligated to make any payments
under the contract beyond the amount appropriated for payment obligations under the contract. The County will provide the
Contractor with written notice of non-appropriation of funds within thirty (30) calendar days after action is completed by the Board
of Supervisors. However, the County’s failure to provide such notice will not extend the contract into a fiscal year in which
sufficient funds have not been appropriated.  
**35. DELIVERY/SERVICE FAILURES** -If a Contractor (i) fails to deliver goods or services within the time specified or within a  
reasonable time as interpreted by the Purchasing Agent; or (ii) fails to make replacements or corrections of rejected articles or
services when so requested, immediately or as directed by the Purchasing Agent, then the Purchasing Agent shall have the
authority to purchase in the open market goods or services of comparable grade or quality to replace goods or services not
delivered or rejected. On all such purchases, the Contractor shall reimburse the County, within a reasonable time specified by
the Purchasing Agent, for any expense incurred in excess of contract prices. Such purchases shall be deducted from the contract
quantities if applicable. Should public necessity demand it, the County reserves the right to use or consume articles delivered or
services performed which are substandard in quality, subject to an adjustment in price to be determined by the Purchasing Agent.  
**36. NON-LIABILITY** -The Contractor shall not be liable in damages for delay in shipment or failure to deliver when such delay or  
failure is the result of fire, flood, strike, the transportation carrier, act of God, act of Government, act of an alien enemy or by any
other circumstances which, in the Purchasing Agent's opinion, are beyond the reasonable control of the Contractor. Under such
circumstances, however, the Purchasing Agent may, at her discretion terminate the contract.  
**37. NON-DISCRIMINATION** -During the performance of this contract, the Contractor agrees as follows:  
a. The Contractor will not discriminate against any employee or applicant for employment because of race, religion, color, sex,
national origin, age, disability, or other basis prohibited by state law relating to discrimination in employment, except where
there is a bona fide occupational qualification reasonably necessary to the normal operation of the Contractor. The Contractor
agrees to post in conspicuous places, available to employees and applicants for employment, notices setting forth the
provisions of this non-discrimination clause.
b. The Contractor, in all solicitations or advertisements for employees placed by or on behalf of the Contractor, will state that
such Contractor is an equal opportunity employer.
c. Notices, advertisements and solicitations placed in accordance with federal law, rule or regulation shall be deemed sufficient
for the purpose of meeting the requirements of this section.
d. The Contractor will include the provisions of the foregoing paragraphs a, b, and c above in every subcontract or purchase
order of over $10,000 so that the provisions will be binding upon each subcontractor or vendor.
e. Contractor shall, throughout the term of this contract, comply with the Human Rights Ordinance, Chapter 11 of the Code of
the County of Fairfax, Virginia, as reenacted or amended. Contractor shall further require that all of its subcontractors will
comply with the Human Rights Ordinance, Chapter 11 of the Code of the County of Fairfax, Virginia, as reenacted or amended  
**38. SMALL, WOMEN-OWNED, AND MINORITY-OWNED BUSINESS USE**  
a. It is the declared policy of the County of Fairfax, through its Small and Minority Business Enterprise Program, that Fairfax
County and its employees undertake every effort to increase opportunity for use of small or minority businesses in all aspects
of procurement to the maximum extent feasible.
b. Where it is practicable for any portion of the awarded contract to be subcontracted to other suppliers, the contractor is
encouraged to offer such subcontracting opportunities to small, women and minority businesses.
c. Where Federal grants or monies are involved, it is the policy of Fairfax County, through its agents and employees, to comply
with the requirements set forth in the Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for
Federal Awards, as they pertain to small and minority business use.  
**39. GUARANTEES & WARRANTIES** -All guarantees and warranties required shall be furnished by the Contractor and shall be  
delivered to the Purchasing Agent before contract execution. Unless otherwise stated, manufacturer's standard warranty applies.  
**40. PRICE REDUCTION** -If the Contractor makes a general price reduction for any material covered by the solicitation to customers  
generally, an equivalent price reduction shall apply to this contract for the duration of the contract period (or until the price is
further reduced). Such price reduction shall be effective at the same time and in the same manner as the reduction in the price
to customers generally. For purpose of this provision, a "general price reduction" shall mean any horizontal reduction in the price
of an article or service offered (1) to Contractor's customers generally, or (2) in the Contractor's price schedule for the class of
customers (i.e., wholesalers, jobbers, or retailers), which was used as the basis for bidding on this solicitation. An occasional
sale at a lower price, or sale of distressed merchandise at a lower price is not a "general price reduction" under this provision.  
28  
RFP 2000004198  
Appendix A
**GENERAL CONDITIONS AND INSTRUCTIONS TO BIDDERS**  
The Contractor shall submit its invoice at such reduced prices indicating on the invoice that the reduction is pursuant to the "Price
Reduction" provision of the contract documents. The Contractor will also within ten days of any general price reduction notify
the Purchasing Agent of such reduction by letter. FAILURE TO DO SO MAY RESULT IN TERMINATION OF THE CONTRACT.  
**41. CHANGES** -If in the Purchasing Agent’s opinion, it becomes proper or necessary in the execution of this contract to make any  
change in design, or to make any alterations that will increase the expense, the Purchasing Agent shall determine an equitable
adjustment to the Contractor’s compensation.  
No payment shall be made to the Contractor for any extra material or services, or of any greater amount of money than stipulated
to be paid in the contract, unless some changes in or additions to the contract requiring additional outlay by the Contractor are
first expressly authorized and ordered in writing by contract amendment or otherwise furnished by the Purchasing Agent.  
**42. PLACING OF ORDERS** -Orders against contracts will be placed with the Contractor by Purchase Order or Procurement Card (P
Card) executed and released by the Purchasing Agent or their designee. When a Blanket Purchase Order has been released
by the Purchasing Agent, telephonic orders may be placed directly with the Contractor by authorized personnel in the ordering
Agency.  
**DELIVERY PROVISIONS**  
**43. SHIPPING INSTRUCTIONS - CONSIGNMENT** -Unless otherwise specified in the solicitation each case, container, package,  
etc., delivered under the contract must be plainly marked, stating the Contractor's name, purchase order number, and delivery
address as indicated in the order. Deliveries must be made within the hours of 8:00 AM - 3:00 PM. Deliveries at any other time
will not be accepted unless specific arrangements have been previously made with the receiver at the delivery point. No

responsibility of the Contractor to insure compliance with these instructions for items that are drop-shipped.  
**44. RESPONSIBILITY FOR MATERIALS OR GOODS TENDERED** -Unless otherwise specified in the solicitation, the Contractor is  
responsible for the materials or supplies covered by the contract until they are delivered at the delivery point designated by the
County.  The Contractor bears all risk of loss on rejected materials or supplies after notice of rejection. Rejected materials or
supplies must be removed by and at the expense of the Contractor promptly after notification of rejection, unless public health
and safety require immediate destruction or other disposal of rejected delivery. If rejected materials are not removed by the
Contractor within ten (10) days after date of notification, the County may return the rejected materials or supplies to the Contractor
at its risk and expense or dispose of them as the County’s own property.  
**45. INSPECTIONS** -Inspection and acceptance of materials or supplies will be made after delivery at the designated destinations  
unless otherwise stated. If inspection is made after delivery at the designated destination, the County will bear the expense of
inspection except for the value of samples used in case of rejection. Final inspection is conclusive except in regard to latent
defects, fraud or such gross mistakes as to amount to fraud. Final inspection and acceptance or rejection of the materials or
supplies will be made as promptly as practicable, but failure to inspect and accept or reject materials or supplies shall not impose
liability on the County for such materials or supplies as are not in accordance with the specifications.  
**46. COMPLIANCE** -Delivery must be made as ordered and in accordance with the contract or as directed by the Purchasing Agent  
when not in conflict with the contract. The decision of the Purchasing Agent as to reasonable compliance with delivery terms
shall be final. If the Contractor claims the delay in receipt of goods was caused by the County, the Contractor must provide
evidence satisfactory to the Purchasing Agent supporting the Contractor’s claim. Any request for extension of delivery time from
that specified in the contract must be approved by the Purchasing Agent, such extension applying only to the particular item or
shipment affected. If the Contractor is delayed by the County, there shall be added to the time of completion a time equal to the
period of such delay caused by the County. However, the Contractor shall not be entitled to claim damages or extra
compensation for such delay or suspension. These conditions may vary for construction contracts. See contract for the individual
instructions.  
**47. POINT OF DESTINATION** -All materials shipped to the County must be shipped F.O.B. DESTINATION unless otherwise stated  
in the contract or purchase order. The materials must be delivered to the "Ship to" address indicated on the purchase order.  
**48. ADDITIONAL CHARGES** -Unless bought F.O.B. "shipping point" and Contractor prepays transportation, no delivery charges  
shall be added to invoices except when express delivery is authorized and substituted on orders for the method specified in the
contract. In such cases, difference between freight or mail and express charges may be added to invoice.  
**49. METHOD AND CONTAINERS** -Unless otherwise specified, goods shall be delivered in commercial packages in standard  
commercial containers that are constructed to ensure acceptance by common or other carrier for safe transportation to the point
of delivery. Containers become the property of the County unless otherwise specified by bidder.

contract, shall be replaced by the Contractor at no cost to the County.

c. The Quantity Ordered,
d. The Quantity Shipped,
e. The Quantity Back Ordered,

**52. BILLING** -Billing for the Fairfax County Public Schools and for County agencies: Unless otherwise specified on the contract or  
purchase order (PO), invoices are to be submitted for each purchase order immediately upon completion of the shipment or

**GENERAL CONDITIONS AND INSTRUCTIONS TO BIDDERS**

a. General Indemnification. Contractor must indemnify, keep and save harmless, and defend the County, its agents, officials,
employees and volunteers against Claims that may accrue or arise against the County as a result of the granting a contract,
if the Claim was caused by the negligence or error, or omission of the Contractor, its employees, its subcontractor, or its
subcontractor’s employees. As used in this Section, a Claim includes: injuries, death, damage to property, breach of data
security, suits, liabilities, judgments, or costs and expenses. Upon request by the County, the Contractor must at its own
expense: appear, defend, and pay all attorney’s fees and all costs and other expenses related to the Claim. If, related to a
Claim, any judgment is rendered against the County or a settlement reached that requires the County to pay money, the
Contractor must at its own expense satisfy and discharge the same. Contractor expressly understands and agrees that any
performance bond or insurance protection required by this Contract, or otherwise provided by the Contractor, does not limit
the Contractor’s responsibility to indemnify, keep and save harmless, and defend the County as provided in this Contract.  
b. Intellectual Property Indemnification. In addition to the General Indemnification, Contractor will indemnify the County for
and defend the County against third-party claims for infringement of any valid United States patent, trademark or copyright
by the Contractor’s products, software, services, or deliverables. Contractor must indemnify the County for any loss,
damage, expense or liability, including costs and reasonable attorney’s fees that may result by reason of any such claim.

products and software, or allow Contractor to continue performing the Services; (b) modify such products, software, services
or deliverables to make them non-infringing; or (c) replace such products or software with a non-infringing equivalent. If, in
the Contractor’s reasonable opinion, none of the foregoing options is feasible Contractor must immediately notify the County
and accept the return of the products, software, services, or deliverables, along with any other components rendered
unusable as a result of the infringement or claimed infringement, and refund to the County the price paid to Contractor for
such components as well as any pre-paid fees for the allegedly infringing services, including license, subscription fees, or
both. Nothing in Paragraph 59, however, relieves the Contractor of liability to the County for damages sustained by the
County by virtue of any breach of contract related to a third-party infringement claim.  
c. Right to Participate in Defense. The County may, at its sole expense, participate in the defense or resolution of a
Claim. Contractor will have primary control of the defense and resolution of the Claim, except when such defense or
resolution requires the County to (i) admit liability or wrongdoing; or (ii) to pay money. In either of these cases Contractor
must obtain the County’s prior written consent before raising such defense or entering into such resolution.  
d. **No Indemnification by the County. The parties agree that under applicable law the County cannot indemnify or**
**defend the Contractor. To the extent any promise or term contained in this Contract, including any exhibits,**

received in connection with a bid, proposal or contract, and that the Contractor has failed to disclose such benefit or has

contracts; provided, that failure to perform or unsatisfactory performance caused by acts beyond the control of the
Contractor shall not be considered to be a basis for suspension or debarment;

that inure to the detriment of Fairfax County or a Fairfax County project ;
