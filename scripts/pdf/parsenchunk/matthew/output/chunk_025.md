Header 2: BASIS FOR AWARD:

18.1. This RFP is being utilized for competitive negotiation. Under the competitive negotiation
process, a contract may be awarded to the responsible offeror whose proposal is determined
to be the most advantageous to the County, taking into consideration price and the evaluation
factors set forth in the RFP. The County reserves the right to make multiple awards as a result
of this solicitation.  
18.2. Separate Selection Advisory Committees (“SACs”) have been established for each labor
category relevant to this procurement. Each SAC will review and evaluate proposals submitted
for its assigned labor category. If an Offeror submits proposals covering multiple labor
categories, each corresponding SAC will evaluate the portion of the proposal related to its
category. Each SAC will conduct a preliminary evaluation of the proposals assigned to it, based
on the information provided and the established evaluation criteria. After this review, the cost
proposals of the highest-rated Offeror(s) within each labor category will be evaluated.  
18.3. No Offeror, including any of their representatives, subcontractors, affiliates and interested
parties, shall contact any member of a SAC or any person involved in the evaluation of the
proposals. SAC members will refer any and all calls related to this procurement to the
procurement official named in 13.1. above. Failure to comply with this directive may, at the sole
discretion of the County, result in the disqualification of an Offeror from the procurement  
process.  
18.4. The County Purchasing Agent may arrange for discussions with firms submitting proposals, if
required, for the purpose of obtaining additional information or clarification.  
18.5. Offerors are advised that, in the event of receipt of an adequate number of proposals, which,
in the opinion of the County Purchasing Agent, require no clarifications and/or supplementary
information, such proposals may be evaluated without further discussion. Consequently,
offerors should provide complete, thorough proposals with the offeror’s most favorable terms.
Should proposals require additional clarification and/or supplementary information, offerors
should submit such additional material in a timely manner.

**SPECIAL PROVISIONS**  
18.## Reference Checks: The County may contact references provided with the proposal. The
Offeror’s ability to meet the service requirements of its customers, and its responsiveness to
its clients will be evaluated through discussions with Offeror references supplied in Offeror
Qualifications and supplemental discovery work, as necessary. Research will target areas
concerning offeror history, such as implementation success, cost overruns, project support and
post implementation support, and may include inquiries concerning the product, such as
stability, flexibility, and usability.  
Note: The County may contact any other site that may have experience with the Offeror’s
products.  
18.8. Each SAC will then conduct a final evaluation of the proposals. Selection shall be made of two
or more Offerors deemed to be fully qualified and best suited among those submitting proposals
to the labor categories, on the basis of the factors involved in the RFP, including price if so
stated in the RFP. Negotiations shall then be conducted with each of the Offerors so selected.
The County will consider all cost and business terms to be negotiable and will not be artificially
constrained by an Offeror's internal corporate policies. In short, Offerors that contend they lack
flexibility because of their corporate policy on a particular negotiation item will face a significant
disadvantage and may not be elevated to the final negotiation phase. After negotiations have
been conducted with each offeror so selected, the County shall select the Offeror which, in its
opinion, has made the best proposal, and shall award the contract to that Offeror.  
18.9. Should the County determine in writing and in its sole discretion that only one Offeror is fully
qualified, or that one Offeror is clearly more highly qualified than the others under consideration,
a contract may be negotiated and awarded to that offeror. Each SAC will make appropriate
recommendations to the County Purchasing Agent, if appropriate, prior to the actual award of
contract.  
18.10. Proposals which, after discussion and submission of additional clarification and/or  
supplementary information, are determined to meet the specifications of this RFP will be
classified as "acceptable". Proposals found not to be acceptable will be classified as
"unacceptable" and no further discussion concerning same will be conducted.  
18.11. The County may cancel this RFP or reject proposals at any time prior to an award and is not  
required to furnish a statement of the reasons why a particular proposal was not deemed to be
the most advantageous.
