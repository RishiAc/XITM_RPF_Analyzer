Header 2: USE OF CONTRACT BY OTHER PUBLIC BODIES:

30.1. Reference Paragraph 71, General Conditions and Instructions to Bidders, Cooperative
Procurement. Offerors are advised that the _resultant_ contract(s) may be extended, with the
authorization of the Offeror, to other public bodies, or public agencies or institutions of the
United States to permit their use of the contract at the same prices and/or discounts and terms
of the resulting contract. If any other public body decides to use the final contract, the
Contractor(s) must deal directly with that public body concerning the placement of orders,
issuance of purchase orders, contractual disputes, invoicing, and payment. The County of
Fairfax acts only as the "Contracting Agent" for these public bodies. Failure to extend a contract
to any public body will have no effect on consideration of your offer.  
30.2. It is the Contractors responsibility to notify the public body(s) of the availability of the contract(s).

determinations as to whether the use of this contract is consistent with their laws, regulations,
and other policies.

bodies may add terms and conditions required by statute, ordinances, and regulations, to the
extent that they do not conflict with this contract’s terms and conditions. If, when preparing
such a contract, the general terms and conditions of a public body are unacceptable to the
Contractor, the Contractor may withdraw its extension of the award to that public body.  
30.5. Fairfax County **shall** **not** be held liable for any costs or damages incurred by another public
body as a result of any award extended to that public body by the Contractor.
