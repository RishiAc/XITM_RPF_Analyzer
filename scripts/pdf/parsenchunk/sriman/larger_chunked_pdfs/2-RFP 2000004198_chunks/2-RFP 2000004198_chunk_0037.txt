shall be authorized to transact business in the Commonwealth as a domestic or foreign business entity if so required by Title
13.1 or Title 50 of the Code of Virginia or as otherwise required by law. Any business entity described above that enters into a
contract with a Fairfax County pursuant to the Fairfax County Purchasing Resolution shall not allow its existence to lapse or its
certificate of authority or registration to transact business in the Commonwealth, if so required under Title 13.1 or Title 50, to be
revoked or cancelled at any time during the term of the contract. Fairfax County may void any contract with a business entity if
the business entity fails to remain in compliance with the provisions of this section.
62. COVENANT AGAINST CONTINGENT FEES-The Contractor warrants that no person or selling agency has been employed or
retained to solicit or secure this contract upon an agreement or understanding for a commission, percentage, brokerage, or
contingent fee, except bona fide employees or bona fide established commercial or selling agencies maintained by the Contractor
for the purpose of securing business. For violation of this warranty, the County shall have the right to terminate or suspend this
contract without liability to the County or in its discretion to deduct from the contract price or consideration, or otherwise recover,
the full amount of such commission, percentage, brokerage, or contingent fee.
63. VIRGINIA FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT-All proceedings, records, contracts and other public records relating to

a. Cost estimates relating to a proposed procurement transaction prepared by or for a public body shall not be open to public
inspection.
b. Any competitive sealed bidding bidder, upon request, shall be afforded the opportunity to inspect bid records within a
reasonable time after the opening of all bids but prior to award, except in the event that the County decides not to accept any
of the bids and to reopen the contract. Otherwise, bid records shall be open to public inspection only after award of the
contract. Any competitive negotiation offeror, upon request, shall be afforded the opportunity to inspect proposal records
within a reasonable time after the evaluation and negotiations of proposals are completed but prior to award except in the

invoke the protections of this section prior to or upon submission of the data or other materials, (ii) identify the data or other
materials to be protected, and (iii) state the reasons why protection is necessary.
