GENERAL CONDITIONS AND INSTRUCTIONS TO BIDDERS
writing and signed by the Purchasing Agent or her authorized agent.
33. SUBLETTING OR ASSIGNMENT -It is mutually understood and agreed that the Contractor shall not assign, transfer, convey,
sublet or otherwise dispose of his or her contractual duties to any other person, firm or corporation, without the previous written
consent of the Purchasing Agent. If the Contractor desires to assign its right to payment of the contract, Contractor shall notify
the Purchasing Agent immediately, in writing, of such assignment of right to payment. In no case shall such assignment of
contract relieve the Contractor from its obligations or change the terms of the contract.
34. FUNDING- The obligation of the County to pay compensation due the Contractor under the contract or any other payment
obligations under any contract awarded pursuant to this contract is subject to appropriations by the Fairfax County Board of
Supervisors to satisfy payment of such obligations. The County’s obligations to make payments during subsequent fiscal years
are dependent upon the same action. If such an appropriation is not made for any fiscal year, the contract shall terminate
effective at the end of the fiscal year for which funds were appropriated and the County will not be obligated to make any payments
under the contract beyond the amount appropriated for payment obligations under the contract. The County will provide the
Contractor with written notice of non-appropriation of funds within thirty (30) calendar days after action is completed by the Board
of Supervisors. However, the County’s failure to provide such notice will not extend the contract into a fiscal year in which
sufficient funds have not been appropriated.
35. DELIVERY/SERVICE FAILURES-If a Contractor (i) fails to deliver goods or services within the time specified or within a
reasonable time as interpreted by the Purchasing Agent; or (ii) fails to make replacements or corrections of rejected articles or
services when so requested, immediately or as directed by the Purchasing Agent, then the Purchasing Agent shall have the
authority to purchase in the open market goods or services of comparable grade or quality to replace goods or services not
delivered or rejected. On all such purchases, the Contractor shall reimburse the County, within a reasonable time specified by
the Purchasing Agent, for any expense incurred in excess of contract prices. Such purchases shall be deducted from the contract
quantities if applicable. Should public necessity demand it, the County reserves the right to use or consume articles delivered or
services performed which are substandard in quality, subject to an adjustment in price to be determined by the Purchasing Agent.
36. NON-LIABILITY-The Contractor shall not be liable in damages for delay in shipment or failure to deliver when such delay or
failure is the result of fire, flood, strike, the transportation carrier, act of God, act of Government, act of an alien enemy or by any
other circumstances which, in the Purchasing Agent's opinion, are beyond the reasonable control of the Contractor. Under such
circumstances, however, the Purchasing Agent may, at her discretion terminate the contract.
