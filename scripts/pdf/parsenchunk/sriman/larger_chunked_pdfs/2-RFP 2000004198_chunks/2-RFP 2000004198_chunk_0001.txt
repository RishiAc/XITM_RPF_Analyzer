SPECIAL PROVISIONS
1. PURPOSE AND SCOPE:
1.1. The purpose of this Request for Proposal (“RFP”) is to solicit sealed proposals from qualified
Offerors to establish one or more Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts for
Information Technology (“IT”) Staff Augmentation services for Fairfax County, Virginia, and
Fairfax County Public Schools (“FCPS”).
1.2. This procurement is conducted by Fairfax County Government (“FCG”) and is established as
a cooperative procurement, allowing other public bodies to participate and utilize the resulting
contracts. FCG and FCPS intend to award multiple contracts to provide Staff Augmentation
services. These contracts will offer flexibility to procure services on an as-needed basis
throughout the contract term; an award does not guarantee work. Tasks orders, Scope of Work
(“SOW”), request, etc. should be issued intermittently based on evolving requirements. The
County and participating public bodies reserve the right to complete services among the
awarded Contractors at their discretion; however, they are not required to do so and may
engage directly with a Contractor on a case-by-case basis.
1.3. The IDIQ contracts will cover the following IT Staff Augmentation labor categories:
1. Infrastructure Technical Support
2. Application Development Support
3. Cyber Security Support
4. Geographical Information Systems (“GIS”) and Mapping Technical Support
5. Unified Communications Support
6. Radio and Wireless Communications
7. Service Desk/NOC Support
2. MINIMUM PRE-QUALIFICATIONS:
Offerors submitting a response must meet the following minimum qualifications. Failure to meet the
minimum pre-qualification requirements will result in the Offeror’s proposal being determined
non-responsive.
2.1. Offerors are required to properly fill out and sign Attachment I (Minimum Pre-Qualifications
Checklist Sheet).
