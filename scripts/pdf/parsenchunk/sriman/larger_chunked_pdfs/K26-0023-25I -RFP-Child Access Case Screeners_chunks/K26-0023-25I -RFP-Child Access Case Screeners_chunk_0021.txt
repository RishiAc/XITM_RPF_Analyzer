on the performance of the contract and reserves the right to consider any information
otherwise available, or to make such additional investigations as it deems necessary
to confirm the Offeror is reasonably susceptible of being selected for award.
b. The Financial Proposal of each remaining Offeror will be evaluated and ranked separately
from the technical evaluation. After a review of the Financial Proposals of remaining
Offerors, the Evaluation Committee and/or Procurement Officer may conduct discussions to
further evaluate the Offeror’s entire proposal.
c. When in the best interest of the AOC, the Procurement Officer may permit remaining
Offerors to revise their initial proposals and submit, in writing, Best and Final Offers
(BAFOs). The AOC may make award without issuing a request for a BAFO.
3. Recommendation for Award
a. Upon completion of the Technical Proposal and Financial Proposal evaluations and rankings,
an overall ranking will be designated to each Offeror.
b. The Procurement Officer will recommend award of the Contract to the Offeror that submitted
the proposal determined to be the most advantageous to the AOC. In making the most
advantageous Offeror’s determination, technical factors shall be given greater weight than
price factors.
E. DEBRIEFING
Unsuccessful Offerors may request a debriefing. If the Offeror chooses to do so, the request must be
submitted in writing to the Procurement Officer within fourteen (14) calendar days from the date they are
notified their proposal was unsuccessful. Debriefings shall be limited to discussion of the specific Offeror’s
proposal only and shall not include a discussion of a competing Offeror’s proposal. Debriefings shall be
provided within thirty (30) calendar days of the award notification date.
