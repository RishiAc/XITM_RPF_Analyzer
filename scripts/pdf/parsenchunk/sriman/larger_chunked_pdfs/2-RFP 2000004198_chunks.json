Selection shall be made of two\nor more Offerors deemed to be fully qualified and best suited among those submitting proposals\nto the labor categories, on the basis of the factors involved in the RFP, including price if so\nstated in the RFP. Negotiations shall then be conducted with each of the Offerors so selected.\nThe County will consider all cost and business terms to be negotiable and will not be artificially\nconstrained by an Offeror's internal corporate policies. In short, Offerors that contend they lack\nflexibility because of their corporate policy on a particular negotiation item will face a significant\ndisadvantage and may not be elevated to the final negotiation phase. After negotiations have\nbeen conducted with each offeror so selected, the County shall select the Offeror which, in its\nopinion, has made the best proposal, and shall award the contract to that Offeror.\n18.9. Should the County determine in writing and in its sole discretion that only one Offeror is fully\nqualified, or that one Offeror is clearly more highly qualified than the others under consideration,\na contract may be negotiated and awarded to that offeror.

APPEAL OF DETERMINATION OF NONRESPONSIBILITY-\na. Any bidder who, despite being the apparent low bidder, is determined not to be a responsible bidder for a particular County\ncontract shall be notified in writing by the Purchasing Agent.
