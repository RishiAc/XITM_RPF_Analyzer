2. Offeror’s attendance at the Pre-proposal Conference is mandatory, in order to facilitate better
preparation of proposals. If the solicitation includes an MBE or VSBE goal, failure to attend the Pre-
proposal Conference will be taken into consideration as part of the evaluation of an Offeror’s good
faith effort if there is a waiver request.
3. MBE & VSBE subcontractors are encouraged to attend the Pre-proposal Conference to solicit their
services to potential Offerors.
4. If there is a need for sign language interpretation or other special accommodations due to a disability,
please notify the Procurement Officer at least five (5) business days prior to the Pre-proposal
Conference. The AOC will make a reasonable effort to provide such special accommodations.
