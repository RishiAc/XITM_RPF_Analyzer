3. To ensure compliance with the JIS Information Security Policy, the approval, configuration, and
monitoring of secured remote access into AOC systems will be processed by JIS staff. All remote
connections that utilize a shared infrastructure must utilize encryption for transmission of data and
authentication.
4. Any software used to meet the requirements of this solicitation, on any AOC system, must be
included in the Offeror’s technical proposal. Software must be assessed by JIS and approved by the
JIS Chief Information Officer. At the discretion of JIS, proposed software may be determined to be
a risk to system and information integrity security controls and therefore rejected. If software is to
be used remotely, the Judiciary shall control the method of access to our network via Virtual Private
Network (VPN), firewall configurations, and/or segregating remote machine access within our
environment.
