SECTION III. SCOPE OF WORK
A. SUMMARY
The AOC is seeking proposals from prospective Offerors to provide resources to screen child access cases
for intimate partner violence, domestic violence, and/or child abuse to assist courts in determining whether
cases are appropriate for mediation pursuant to Md. Rule 9-205. There is no guaranteed minimum usage.
Offeror may propose no more than three (3) resource(s). Offeror shall propose resource(s) for which they
have the right to represent. If multiple Offerors propose the same resource(s), the AOC reserves the right to
make such investigations, as it deems necessary, to confirm the representation of any proposed resource(s)
and reject any Offeror’s proposed resource(s). After any investigations, if the AOC is unable to confirm the
representation of any proposed resource(s), including a proposed resource who signed multiple right-to-
represent letters, the AOC reserves the right to reject the proposed resource(s) from all applicable Offerors.
