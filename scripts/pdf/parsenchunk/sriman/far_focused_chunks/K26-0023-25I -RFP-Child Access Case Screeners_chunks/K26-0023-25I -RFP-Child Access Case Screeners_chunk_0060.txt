Resource(s).
a. The AOC reserves the right to determine an off-site location is not suitable (e.g., crowded
public space with distracting background noise during meetings).
b. The Offeror proposed resource may not perform remote work from a country other than the
United States of America without prior approval from the Contract Manager. Unless there
are extenuating circumstances, Offerors shall not anticipate receiving approval for remote
work from a country other than the United States of America.
