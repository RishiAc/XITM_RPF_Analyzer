GENERAL CONDITIONS AND INSTRUCTIONS TO BIDDERS
24. TIE-BIDS – If all bids are for the same total amount or unit price (including authorized discounts and delivery times), and if the
public interest will not permit the delay of re-advertisement for bids, the Purchasing Agent is authorized to award the contract to
the tie bidder that has its principal place of business in the County, or if there be none, to the resident Virginia tie bidder, or if
there be none, to one of the tie bidders by drawing lots in public; or the Purchasing Agent may purchase the goods or services
in the open market except that the price paid shall not exceed the lowest contract bid price submitted for the same goods or
services. The decision of the County to make award to one or more such bidders shall be final.
