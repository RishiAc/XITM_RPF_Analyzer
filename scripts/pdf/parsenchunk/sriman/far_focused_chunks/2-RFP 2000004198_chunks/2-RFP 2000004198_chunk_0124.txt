35. DELIVERY/SERVICE FAILURES-If a Contractor (i) fails to deliver goods or services within the time specified or within a
reasonable time as interpreted by the Purchasing Agent; or (ii) fails to make replacements or corrections of rejected articles or
services when so requested, immediately or as directed by the Purchasing Agent, then the Purchasing Agent shall have the
authority to purchase in the open market goods or services of comparable grade or quality to replace goods or services not
delivered or rejected. On all such purchases, the Contractor shall reimburse the County, within a reasonable time specified by
the Purchasing Agent, for any expense incurred in excess of contract prices. Such purchases shall be deducted from the contract
quantities if applicable. Should public necessity demand it, the County reserves the right to use or consume articles delivered or
services performed which are substandard in quality, subject to an adjustment in price to be determined by the Purchasing Agent.
