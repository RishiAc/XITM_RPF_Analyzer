22. AWARD OR REJECTION OF BIDS-The Purchasing Agent shall award the contract to the lowest responsive and responsible
bidder complying with all provisions of the IFB, provided the bid price is reasonable and it is in the best interest of the County to
accept it. Awards made in response to a RFP will be made to the highest qualified offeror whose proposal is determined, in
writing, to be the most advantageous to the County taking into consideration the evaluation factors set forth in the RFP. The
Purchasing Agent reserves the right to award a contract by individual items, in the aggregate, or in combination thereof, or to
reject any or all bids and to waive any informality in bids received whenever such rejection or waiver is in the best interest of the
County. Award may be made to as many bidders as deemed necessary to fulfill the anticipated requirements of Fairfax County.
The Purchasing Agent also reserves the right to reject the bid of a bidder deemed to be a non-responsible bidder.
In determining the responsibility of a bidder, the following criteria will be considered:
a. The ability, capacity and skill of the bidder to perform the contract or provide the service required;
b. Whether the bidder can perform the contract or provide the service promptly, or within the time specified, without delay or
interference;
