8. ACCEPTANCE OF BIDS/BINDING 90 DAYS-Unless otherwise specified, all formal bids submitted shall be binding for ninety
(90) calendar days following bid opening date, unless extended by mutual consent of all parties.
9. CONDITIONAL BIDS-Conditional bids may be rejected in whole or in part.
10. BIDS FOR ALL OR PART-The Purchasing Agent reserves the right to make award on all items in the aggregate or on any of
the items on an individual basis, whichever is in the best interest of the County. A bidder may restrict its bid to consideration in
the group aggregate by so stating, but must name a single unit price on each item bid. Any bid in which the bidder names a total
price for all the articles without quoting a unit price for each and every separate item may not be considered for award.
