1. AUTHORITY-The Purchasing Agent has the sole responsibility and authority for purchasing supplies, materials, equipment, and
services, except as excluded in the Fairfax County Purchasing Resolution. The Purchasing Agent’s responsibility and authority
includes, but is not limited to, issuing and modifying solicitations, negotiating and executing contracts, and placing purchase
orders. In discharging these responsibilities, the Purchasing Agent may be assisted by contract specialists. Unless specifically
delegated by the Purchasing Agent, no other County officer or employee is authorized to order supplies or services, enter into
purchase negotiations or contracts, or in any way obligate the government of the County of Fairfax for an indebtedness. Any
purchase ordered or contract made that is contrary to these provisions and authorities shall be of no effect, void, and does not
bind the County.
