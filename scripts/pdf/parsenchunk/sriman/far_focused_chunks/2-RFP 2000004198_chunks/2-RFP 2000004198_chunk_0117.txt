25. PROMPT PAYMENT DISCOUNT-
a. Unless otherwise specified in the solicitation, prompt payment discounts requiring payment in less than fifteen (15) days will
not be considered in evaluating a bid for award. However, even though not considered in the evaluation, such discounts will
be taken if payment is to be made within the discount period.
b. If a discount for prompt payment is allowed, the discount period will begin on the date of receipt of a properly completed
invoice or acceptance of materials or services, whichever is later.
c. For determining acceptance of supplies in accordance with the provisions of the prompt payment discount paragraph,
inspection and acceptance shall be accomplished only after examination (including testing) of supplies and services to
determine whether the supplies and services conform to the contract requirements.
For the purpose of earning the discount, payment is deemed to be made as of the date of mailing of the County check or issuance
of an Electronic Funds Transfer, or completion of a credit card transaction.
