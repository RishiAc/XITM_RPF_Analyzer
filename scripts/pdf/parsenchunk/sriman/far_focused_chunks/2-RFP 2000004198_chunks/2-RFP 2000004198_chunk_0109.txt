17. PROHIBITION AGAINST UNIFORM PRICING-The Purchasing Agent encourages open and competitive bidding by all possible
means and endeavors to obtain the maximum degree of open competition on all purchase transactions using the methods of
procurement authorized by the Fairfax County Purchasing Resolution. Each bidder, by virtue of submitting a bid, guarantees
that it has not been a party with other bidders to an agreement to bid a fixed or uniform price. Violation of this implied guarantee
shall render void the bids of participating bidders. Any disclosure to or acquisition by a competitive bidder, in advance of the
opening of the bids, of the terms or conditions of the bid submitted by another competitor may render the entire proceedings void
and may require re-advertising for bids.
