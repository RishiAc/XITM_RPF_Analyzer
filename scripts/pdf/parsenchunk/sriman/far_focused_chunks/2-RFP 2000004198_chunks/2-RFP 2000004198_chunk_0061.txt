18.2. Separate Selection Advisory Committees (“SACs”) have been established for each labor
category relevant to this procurement. Each SAC will review and evaluate proposals submitted
for its assigned labor category. If an Offeror submits proposals covering multiple labor
categories, each corresponding SAC will evaluate the portion of the proposal related to its
category. Each SAC will conduct a preliminary evaluation of the proposals assigned to it, based
on the information provided and the established evaluation criteria. After this review, the cost
proposals of the highest-rated Offeror(s) within each labor category will be evaluated.
