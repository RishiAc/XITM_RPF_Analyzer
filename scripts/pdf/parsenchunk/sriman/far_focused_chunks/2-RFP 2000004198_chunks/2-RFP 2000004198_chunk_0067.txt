=== CHUNK CONTENT ===
The County will consider all cost and business terms to be negotiable and will not be artificially
constrained by an Offeror's internal corporate policies. In short, Offerors that contend they lack
flexibility because of their corporate policy on a particular negotiation item will face a significant
disadvantage and may not be elevated to the final negotiation phase. After negotiations have
been conducted with each offeror so selected, the County shall select the Offeror which, in its
opinion, has made the best proposal, and shall award the contract to that Offeror.
