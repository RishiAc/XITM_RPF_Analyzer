with the requirements set forth in the Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for
Federal Awards, as they pertain to small and minority business use.
39. GUARANTEES & WARRANTIES-All guarantees and warranties required shall be furnished by the Contractor and shall be
delivered to the Purchasing Agent before contract execution. Unless otherwise stated, manufacturer's standard warranty applies.
40. PRICE REDUCTION-If the Contractor makes a general price reduction for any material covered by the solicitation to customers
generally, an equivalent price reduction shall apply to this contract for the duration of the contract period (or until the price is
further reduced). Such price reduction shall be effective at the same time and in the same manner as the reduction in the price
to customers generally. For purpose of this provision, a "general price reduction" shall mean any horizontal reduction in the price
of an article or service offered (1) to Contractor's customers generally, or (2) in the Contractor's price schedule for the class of
customers (i.e., wholesalers, jobbers, or retailers), which was used as the basis for bidding on this solicitation. An occasional
sale at a lower price, or sale of distressed merchandise at a lower price is not a "general price reduction" under this provision.
