54. PARTIAL PAYMENTS-Unless otherwise specified, partial payments will be made upon acceptance of materials or services so
invoiced if in accordance with completion date. However, up to 5 percent (5%) of the value of the entire order may be retained
until completion of contract.
55. PAYMENT FOR EQUIPMENT, INSTALLATION, AND TESTING-When equipment requires installation (which includes erection,
setting up or placing in position, service, or use) and testing, and the installation or testing is delayed, payment may be made on
the basis of 50% of the contract price when such equipment is delivered on the site. A further allowance of 25% may be made
when the equipment is installed and ready for test. The balance shall be paid after the equipment is tested and found to be
satisfactory. If the equipment must be tested, but installation is not required to be made by the Contractor or if the equipment
must be installed but testing is not required, payment may be made on the basis of 75% at the time of delivery and the balance
shall be paid after satisfactory test or installation is completed.
