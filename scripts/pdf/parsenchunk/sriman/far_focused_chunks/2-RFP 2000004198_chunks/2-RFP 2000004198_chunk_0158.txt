68. CONTRACTUAL DISPUTES-
a. Any dispute concerning a question of fact as a result of a contract with the County which is not disposed of by agreement
shall be decided by the Purchasing Agent, who shall reduce her decision to writing and mail or otherwise forward a copy to
the Contractor within ninety (90) days. The decision of the Purchasing Agent shall be final and conclusive unless the
Contractor appeals within six (6) months of the date of the final written decision by instituting legal action as provided in the
Code of Virginia. A Contractor may not institute legal action, prior to receipt of the Purchasing Agent’s decision on the claim,
unless the Purchasing Agent fails to render such decision within the time specified.
b. Contractual claims, whether for money or other relief, shall be submitted in writing no later than sixty days after final payment;
however, written notice of the Contractor's intention to file such claim shall have been given at the time of the occurrence or
beginning of the work upon which the claim is based. Nothing herein shall preclude a contract from requiring submission of
an invoice for final payment within a certain time after completion and acceptance of the work or acceptance of the goods.
Pendency of claims shall not delay payment of amounts agreed due in the final payment.
