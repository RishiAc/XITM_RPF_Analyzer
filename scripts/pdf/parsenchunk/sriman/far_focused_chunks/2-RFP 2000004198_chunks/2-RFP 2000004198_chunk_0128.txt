GENERAL CONDITIONS AND INSTRUCTIONS TO BIDDERS
The Contractor shall submit its invoice at such reduced prices indicating on the invoice that the reduction is pursuant to the "Price
Reduction" provision of the contract documents. The Contractor will also within ten days of any general price reduction notify
the Purchasing Agent of such reduction by letter. FAILURE TO DO SO MAY RESULT IN TERMINATION OF THE CONTRACT.
41. CHANGES-If in the Purchasing Agent’s opinion, it becomes proper or necessary in the execution of this contract to make any
change in design, or to make any alterations that will increase the expense, the Purchasing Agent shall determine an equitable
adjustment to the Contractor’s compensation.
No payment shall be made to the Contractor for any extra material or services, or of any greater amount of money than stipulated
to be paid in the contract, unless some changes in or additions to the contract requiring additional outlay by the Contractor are
first expressly authorized and ordered in writing by contract amendment or otherwise furnished by the Purchasing Agent.
