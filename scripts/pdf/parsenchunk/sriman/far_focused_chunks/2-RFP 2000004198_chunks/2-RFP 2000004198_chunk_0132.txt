46. COMPLIANCE-Delivery must be made as ordered and in accordance with the contract or as directed by the Purchasing Agent
when not in conflict with the contract. The decision of the Purchasing Agent as to reasonable compliance with delivery terms
shall be final. If the Contractor claims the delay in receipt of goods was caused by the County, the Contractor must provide
evidence satisfactory to the Purchasing Agent supporting the Contractor’s claim. Any request for extension of delivery time from
that specified in the contract must be approved by the Purchasing Agent, such extension applying only to the particular item or
shipment affected. If the Contractor is delayed by the County, there shall be added to the time of completion a time equal to the
period of such delay caused by the County. However, the Contractor shall not be entitled to claim damages or extra
compensation for such delay or suspension. These conditions may vary for construction contracts. See contract for the individual
instructions.
