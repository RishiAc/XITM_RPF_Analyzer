SPECIAL PROVISIONS
5.3.3. Deviations: Deviations from the architecture and standards may become a barrier
to the sustainability of the County’s integration and interoperability posture and may
be subject to further review. When responding to various statements of work during
the duration of this contract, offerors must specifically disclose all aspects of the
proposed solution which deviate from the documented standards and desired
architectures, and provide approaches for consideration about the manner in which
non-standard components may be integrated.
5.3.4. Graphical User Interfaces: The County has standard templates that are required for
its websites to have maximum consistency across applications and content. Any
hosted applications and most COTS applications should be able to present through
the County template or simulation for County brand and identity. Alternatives to
using these templates must be arranged through the County DIT.
