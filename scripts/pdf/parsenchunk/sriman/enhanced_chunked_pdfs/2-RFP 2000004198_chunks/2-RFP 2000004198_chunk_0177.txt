Procurement. Offerors are advised that the resultant contract(s) may be extended, with the
authorization of the Offeror, to other public bodies, or public agencies or institutions of the
United States to permit their use of the contract at the same prices and/or discounts and terms
of the resulting contract. If any other public body decides to use the final contract, the
Contractor(s) must deal directly with that public body concerning the placement of orders,
issuance of purchase orders, contractual disputes, invoicing, and payment. The County of
Fairfax acts only as the "Contracting Agent" for these public bodies. Failure to extend a contract
to any public body will have no effect on consideration of your offer.
