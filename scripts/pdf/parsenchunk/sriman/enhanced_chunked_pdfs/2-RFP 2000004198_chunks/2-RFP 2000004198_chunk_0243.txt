unless otherwise stated. If inspection is made after delivery at the designated destination, the County will bear the expense of
inspection except for the value of samples used in case of rejection. Final inspection is conclusive except in regard to latent
defects, fraud or such gross mistakes as to amount to fraud. Final inspection and acceptance or rejection of the materials or
supplies will be made as promptly as practicable, but failure to inspect and accept or reject materials or supplies shall not impose
liability on the County for such materials or supplies as are not in accordance with the specifications.
