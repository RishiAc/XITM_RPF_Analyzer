=== CHUNK CONTENT ===
obligations under any contract awarded pursuant to this contract is subject to appropriations by the Fairfax County Board of
Supervisors to satisfy payment of such obligations. The County’s obligations to make payments during subsequent fiscal years
are dependent upon the same action. If such an appropriation is not made for any fiscal year, the contract shall terminate
effective at the end of the fiscal year for which funds were appropriated and the County will not be obligated to make any payments
under the contract beyond the amount appropriated for payment obligations under the contract. The County will provide the
Contractor with written notice of non-appropriation of funds within thirty (30) calendar days after action is completed by the Board
of Supervisors. However, the County’s failure to provide such notice will not extend the contract into a fiscal year in which
sufficient funds have not been appropriated.
