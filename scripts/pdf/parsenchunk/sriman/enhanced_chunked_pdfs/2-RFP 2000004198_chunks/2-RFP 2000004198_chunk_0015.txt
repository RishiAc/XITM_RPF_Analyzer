other payment obligations under any contract awarded pursuant to this Request for Proposal
is subject to appropriations by the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors to satisfy payment of
such obligations. The County’s obligations to make payments during subsequent fiscal years
are dependent upon the same action. If such an appropriation is not made for any fiscal year,
the contract shall terminate effective at the end of the fiscal year for which funds were
appropriated and the County will not be obligated to make any payments under the contract
beyond the amount appropriated for payment obligations under the contract. The County will
provide the contractor with written notice of non-appropriation of funds within thirty (30)
calendar days after action is completed by the Board of Supervisors. However, the County’s
failure to provide such notice shall not extend the contract into a fiscal year in which sufficient
funds have not been appropriated.
