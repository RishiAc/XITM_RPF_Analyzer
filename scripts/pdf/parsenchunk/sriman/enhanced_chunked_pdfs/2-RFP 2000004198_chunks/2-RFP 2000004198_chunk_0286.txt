GENERAL CONDITIONS AND INSTRUCTIONS TO BIDDERS
c. Pending final determination of a protest or appeal, the validity of a contract awarded and accepted in good faith in accordance
with this article shall not be affected by the fact that a protest or appeal has been filed.
d. An award need not be delayed for the period allowed a bidder or offeror to protest, but in the event of a timely protest, no
further action to award the contract will be taken unless there is a written determination that proceeding without delay is
necessary to protect the public interest or unless the bid or offer would expire.
