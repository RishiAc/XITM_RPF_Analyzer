=== CHUNK CONTENT ===
manufacturer does not restrict bidders to the specific brand, make or manufacturer named; it conveys the general style, type,
character, and quality of the article desired. Any article that the County in its sole discretion determines to be the equivalent of
that specified, considering quality, workmanship, economy of operation, and suitability for the purpose intended, shall be
accepted. The bidder is responsible for clearly and specifically identifying the product being offered and providing sufficient
descriptive literature, catalog cuts and technical detail to enable the County to determine if the product offered meets the
requirements of the solicitation. This is required even if offering the exact brand, make, or manufacturer specified. Failure to
furnish adequate data for evaluation purposes may result in declaring a bid nonresponsive. Unless the bidder clearly indicates
in its bid that the product is an equivalent product, such bid will be considered to offer the brand name product referenced in the
solicitation.
