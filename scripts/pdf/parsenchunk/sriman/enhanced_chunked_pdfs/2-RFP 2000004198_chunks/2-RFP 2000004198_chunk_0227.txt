=== CHUNK CONTENT ===
a. If, through any cause, the Contractor fails to fulfill in a timely and proper manner its obligations under this contract, or if the
Contractor violates any of the covenants, agreements, or stipulations of this contract, the County has the right to terminate
the contract. Any such termination will be effected by delivery to the Contractor of a Notice of Termination specifying the
extent to which performance is terminated and the date upon which termination becomes effective. In such event, all finished
or unfinished documents, data, studies, surveys, drawings, maps, models, and reports prepared by the Contractor under the
contract shall, at the option of the County, become the County’s property and the Contractor shall be entitled to receive just
and equitable compensation for any satisfactory work completed on such documents.
b. Termination of the Contract for Cause does not relieve the Contractor of liability to the County for damages sustained by the
County by virtue of any breach of contract by the Contractor for the purpose of set off until such time as the exact amount of
damages due to the County from the Contractor is determined.
