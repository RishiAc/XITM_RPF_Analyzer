=== CHUNK CONTENT ===
generally, an equivalent price reduction shall apply to this contract for the duration of the contract period (or until the price is
further reduced). Such price reduction shall be effective at the same time and in the same manner as the reduction in the price
to customers generally. For purpose of this provision, a "general price reduction" shall mean any horizontal reduction in the price
of an article or service offered (1) to Contractor's customers generally, or (2) in the Contractor's price schedule for the class of
customers (i.e., wholesalers, jobbers, or retailers), which was used as the basis for bidding on this solicitation. An occasional
sale at a lower price, or sale of distressed merchandise at a lower price is not a "general price reduction" under this provision.
