=== CHUNK CONTENT ===
a. A decision denying withdrawal of a bid submitted by a bidder or offeror shall be final and conclusive unless the bidder appeals
the decision within ten (10) days after receipt of the decision by instituting legal action as provided in the Code of Virginia.
The bidder or offeror may not institute legal action until all statutory requirements have been met.
b. If no bid bond was posted, a bidder refused withdrawal of bid under the provisions of Article 2, Section 5.A.8, of the Fairfax
County Purchasing Resolution, prior to appealing, shall deliver to the County a certified check or cash bond in the amount of
the difference between the bid sought to be withdrawn and the next low bid. Such security shall be released only upon a
final determination that the bidder was entitled to withdraw the bid.
c. If, upon appeal, it is determined that the decision refusing withdrawal of the bid was not an honest exercise of discretion, but
rather was arbitrary or capricious or not in accordance with the Constitution of Virginia, applicable state law or regulation, or
the terms or conditions of the Invitation to Bid, the sole relief shall be withdrawal of the bid.
