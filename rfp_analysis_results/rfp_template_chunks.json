An initial contract term of less than 20 years may be beneficial\nso that the contract can be extended if the estimated PV System FMV increases significantly during the\ncontract term. This will provide additional time for the required ESCO\u2019s reserve account funds to be\naccumulated. The alternative is to increase the government\u2019s payments that are to be allocated to the ESCO\u2019s\nreserve account. This will only be allowed if the statutory savings requirement is still met and may require a\nmore extensive contract modification.]\nThe ESPC ESA contract term will begin upon contract award and continue for <x> years, unless terminated\nearlier pursuant to the provisions of this contract.\nF.2 Place of Performance\nThe place of performance for this contract is the following:\n<List of PV System(s) location and type (rooftop, carport, ground-mount)>\nF.3 Notice to Proceed (NTP)\nBoth the design and construction phases of the contract will begin upon receiving a written NTP from\n<agency>.

The PV System design\nshall be submitted within <x> days of the design NTP letter date.

Limited construction NTP, in advance of the official construction NTP, may be\ngranted upon request for purposes of ordering equipment with long lead-time. Limited construction NTP will\nonly be granted by <agency> after review of the equipment specs to ensure that they meet all contract\nrequirements.\nF.4 Contract Performance Deliverables\nConstruction and acceptance of the PV System shall be completed by <date>. The Contractor will not be held\nresponsible for <agency> or other Government delays. In case of delays that are not the fault of the\nContractor, a new completion date shall be proposed by the Contractor, for approval by the <agency>.\n6 As stated in Section A, tax incentive eligibility due diligence is the responsibility of the ESCO, not the\ngovernment.\nPage 13 of 38\nF.4.1 PV System Design <and Structural Analysis>\nPV system designs are due <x> days after design NTP.

Creation of an SPE under an ESPC ESA\nrequires the execution of a novation agreement by the agency CO and prime contractor to recognize a\nsuccessor in interest to the agency contract when contractor assets are transferred.\nThe ESPC statutory authority provides that an agency may enter into an ESPC with an ESCO that is on a\nqualified list established pursuant to the requirements under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 8287(b)(2)(A). The initial award of\nan ESPC ESA to a qualified list ESCO satisfies this requirement, even though the newly created SPE may not\nbe on an established qualified list.\nAny subsequent agreement that is executed to novate the contract to a SPE must be approved by the\nresponsible contracting officer and must be consistent with all applicable statutory and regulatory\nrequirements.

Novation agreement approval is at the\n<agency\u2019s> sole discretion pending a determination by the CO that the SPE is capable of meeting all contract\nrequirements and obtaining financing.\nThe planned use of an LLC or other type of SPE should be identified in the proposal as part of the Preliminary\nProject Finance Plan (see Section H.16).\n[If this agreement is novated, a novation may also be required for the site access agreement.]\nH.2 Title to the PV System\nUntil such time as the <agency> accepts title to the PV System, the ESCO shall be the legal and beneficial\nowner of the PV System. During this time, the system shall be the personal property of the ESCO as defined\nunder Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code and shall not be deemed as part of, or fixture to, the\nPremises.
