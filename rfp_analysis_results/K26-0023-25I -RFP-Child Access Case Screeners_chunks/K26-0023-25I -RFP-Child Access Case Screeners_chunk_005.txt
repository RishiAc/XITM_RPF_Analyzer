2. The Successful Offeror shall ensure the list of authorized Offeror personnel is always maintained
and accurate. The system access rights of Successful Offeror personnel must be updated no later than
twenty-four (24) hours after notification of the change in status; therefore, the Successful Offeror
shall immediately notify the Contract Manager and JIS Information Security of any termination of
Successful Offeror personnel or if any approved Successful Offeror personnel no longer require
access to an AOC system. The AOC security identification badge and all issued AOC assets must be
immediately returned to the Contract Manager.
3. To ensure compliance with the JIS Information Security Policy, the approval, configuration, and
monitoring of secured remote access into AOC systems will be processed by JIS staff. All remote
connections that utilize a shared infrastructure must utilize encryption for transmission of data and
authentication.
4. Any software used to meet the requirements of this solicitation, on any AOC system, must be
included in the Offeror’s technical proposal. Software must be assessed by JIS and approved by the
JIS Chief Information Officer. At the discretion of JIS, proposed software may be determined to be
a risk to system and information integrity security controls and therefore rejected. If software is to
be used remotely, the Judiciary shall control the method of access to our network via Virtual Private
Network (VPN), firewall configurations, and/or segregating remote machine access within our
environment.
5. Offerors using an As-a-Service (e.g., infrastructure, software, platform, hardware) subservice hosting
provider (e.g., Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud Platform) must submit a
current Service Organization Control (SOC) 2 Type II report, or equivalent (as determined by the
AOC), for the subservice and for the As-a-Service service provider. A SOC 2 Type II report for the
subservice alone does not meet the requirements of this solicitation.
