Offeror’s ability to meet the requirements of this RFP.
J. PUBLIC ACCESS TO JUDICIAL RECORDS
1. An Offeror shall specifically identify those portions of its proposal that it considers confidential,
proprietary commercial information, or trade secret, and provide justification why such materials,
upon request, shall not be disclosed by the AOC under Title 16, Chapter 900 of the Maryland Rules.
2. The inspection of Judiciary procurement documents shall be governed exclusively by the Judicial
Branch Procurement Policy. Procurement documents are presumed to be open to the public for
inspection, except as otherwise provided by the Judicial Branch Procurement Policy.

subcontractor during the life of the Contract that was not identified in the proposal or the role of an
identified subcontractor otherwise changes, the Successful Offeror shall obtain approval from the
Contract Manager. If applicable, subcontractors utilized in meeting the established MBE or VSBE
participation goal(s) shall be identified as provided in the appropriate MBE/VSBE forms attached to
this RFP.
3. If an Offeror that seeks to perform or provide the services required by this RFP is the subsidiary of
another entity, all information submitted by the Offeror such as, but not limited to, references and
financial reports, shall pertain exclusively to the Offeror, unless the parent organization will
guarantee the performance of the subsidiary. If applicable, the Offeror’s proposal must contain an
explicit statement, signed by an authorized representative of the parent organization, stating that the
parent organization consents to the terms of the RFP and will guarantee the performance of the
subsidiary.
4. A parental guarantee of the performance of the Offeror under this section will not automatically
result in crediting the Offeror with the experience or qualification of the parent under any evaluation
criteria pertaining to the actual Offeror’s experience and qualifications. The Offeror will be evaluated
on the extent to which the AOC determines that the experience and qualifications of the parent are
applicable to and shared with the Offeror, any stated intent by the parent to be directly involved in
the performance of the contract, and the value of the parent’s participation as determined by the
AOC.
5. The Successful Offeror will be required to follow all current Judiciary protocols referencing
pandemic flu or other infectious diseases including, but not limited to, proof of vaccination,
producing negative COVID tests, completing/passing an initial screening questionnaire, non-contact
temperature taking, the wearing of personal protective equipment (e.g., face mask), and practicing
appropriate social distancing. Failure to comply with any of the Judiciary’s protocol could result in
being denied entry into Judiciary workspace, and mitigation up to and including contract termination.
