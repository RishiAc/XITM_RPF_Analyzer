4. A parental guarantee of the performance of the Offeror under this section will not automatically
result in crediting the Offeror with the experience or qualification of the parent under any evaluation
criteria pertaining to the actual Offeror’s experience and qualifications. The Offeror will be evaluated
on the extent to which the AOC determines that the experience and qualifications of the parent are
applicable to and shared with the Offeror, any stated intent by the parent to be directly involved in
the performance of the contract, and the value of the parent’s participation as determined by the
AOC.
