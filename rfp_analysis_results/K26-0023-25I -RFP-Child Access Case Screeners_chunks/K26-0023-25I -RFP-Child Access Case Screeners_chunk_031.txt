2. The AOC reserves the right to utilize the services of individuals outside of the established Evaluation
Committee for advice and assistance, as deemed appropriate by the Procurement Officer.
B. TECHNICAL PROPOSAL CRITERIA
The criteria to be applied to each Technical Proposal are listed in descending order of importance. Unless
stated otherwise, any sub-criteria within each criterion have equal weight.
1. Interview (shortlisted Offeror resources only). Degree to which the proposed resource(s)
demonstrates the skills, experience, and capabilities outlined in Section III.E.;
2. Extent to which the proposed resource(s) resume, education, and narrative demonstrates the
Qualifications, skills, experience, and capabilities outlined in Section III;
3. Extent to which the proposed resource(s) references demonstrate their ability to provide the requested
services outlined in Section III;
The AOC prefers the Offeror’s Technical Proposal to illustrate a comprehensive understanding of work
requirements and mastery of the subject matter, including an explanation of how the work will be performed.
Technical Proposals which include limited responses to work requirements such as “concur” or “will comply”
sample will receive a lower ranking than Technical Proposals that demonstrate an understanding of the work
requirements and include plans to meet or exceed requirements.
C. FINANCIAL PROPOSAL CRITERIA
All Offerors will be ranked from the lowest (most advantageous) to the highest (least advantageous) price
based on their total proposed price set forth in this RFP and as submitted on the Bid/Price Proposal Form
and/or the requested total price.
D. SELECTION PROCEDURES
1. The Procurement Officer shall initially review for compliance with the RFP requirements. Failure to
comply with RFP requirements may result in a proposal being classified as not reasonably susceptible
of being selected for award. Minor irregularities in proposals that are immaterial or inconsequential
in nature may be cured or waived whenever it is determined to be in the AOCs best interest.
