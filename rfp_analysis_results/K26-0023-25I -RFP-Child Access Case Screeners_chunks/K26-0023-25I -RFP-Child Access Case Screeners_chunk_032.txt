================================================================================

2. Selection Procedures:
a. Technical Proposals are evaluated for technical merit and ranked. During this review, oral
presentations, interviews, and discussions may be held. The purpose of such discussions
shall be to assure a full understanding of the AOCs requirements and the Offeror’s ability to
perform, and to facilitate understanding of the Contract that shall be most advantageous to
the AOC.
(1) At the discretion of the Procurement Officer, following the recommendation of the
Evaluation Committee, a shortlist of Offerors may be established during the
technical evaluation. Only shortlisted Offerors would continue in the evaluation
process; Offerors not shortlisted shall be so advised.
(2) Offerors must confirm in writing any substantive oral clarifications of, or changes
in, their Technical Proposal made during discussions. Any such written clarifications
or changes become part of the Offeror’s Technical Proposal.
(3) The AOC may require any Offeror to furnish additional information regarding past
performance, financial capacity, technical expertise, or other qualifications bearing

on the performance of the contract and reserves the right to consider any information
otherwise available, or to make such additional investigations as it deems necessary
to confirm the Offeror is reasonably susceptible of being selected for award.
b. The Financial Proposal of each remaining Offeror will be evaluated and ranked separately
from the technical evaluation. After a review of the Financial Proposals of remaining
Offerors, the Evaluation Committee and/or Procurement Officer may conduct discussions to
further evaluate the Offeror’s entire proposal.
c. When in the best interest of the AOC, the Procurement Officer may permit remaining
Offerors to revise their initial proposals and submit, in writing, Best and Final Offers
(BAFOs). The AOC may make award without issuing a request for a BAFO.
