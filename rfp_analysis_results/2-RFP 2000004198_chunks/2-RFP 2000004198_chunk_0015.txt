on the information provided and the established evaluation criteria. After this review, the cost
proposals of the highest-rated Offeror(s) within each labor category will be evaluated.
18.3. No Offeror, including any of their representatives, subcontractors, affiliates and interested
parties, shall contact any member of a SAC or any person involved in the evaluation of the
proposals. SAC members will refer any and all calls related to this procurement to the
procurement official named in 13.1. above. Failure to comply with this directive may, at the sole
discretion of the County, result in the disqualification of an Offeror from the procurement
process.
18.4. The County Purchasing Agent may arrange for discussions with firms submitting proposals, if
required, for the purpose of obtaining additional information or clarification.
18.5. Offerors are advised that, in the event of receipt of an adequate number of proposals, which,
in the opinion of the County Purchasing Agent, require no clarifications and/or supplementary
information, such proposals may be evaluated without further discussion. Consequently,
offerors should provide complete, thorough proposals with the offeror’s most favorable terms.
Should proposals require additional clarification and/or supplementary information, offerors
should submit such additional material in a timely manner.

The following factors will be considered in the award of this contract(s):

SPECIAL PROVISIONS
18.7. Reference Checks: The County may contact references provided with the proposal. The
Offeror’s ability to meet the service requirements of its customers, and its responsiveness to
its clients will be evaluated through discussions with Offeror references supplied in Offeror
Qualifications and supplemental discovery work, as necessary. Research will target areas
concerning offeror history, such as implementation success, cost overruns, project support and
post implementation support, and may include inquiries concerning the product, such as
stability, flexibility, and usability.
Note: The County may contact any other site that may have experience with the Offeror’s
products.
18.8. Each SAC will then conduct a final evaluation of the proposals. Selection shall be made of two
or more Offerors deemed to be fully qualified and best suited among those submitting proposals
to the labor categories, on the basis of the factors involved in the RFP, including price if so
stated in the RFP. Negotiations shall then be conducted with each of the Offerors so selected.
