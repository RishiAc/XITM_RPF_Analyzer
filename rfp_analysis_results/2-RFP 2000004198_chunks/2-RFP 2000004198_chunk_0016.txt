=== CHUNK CONTENT ===
The County will consider all cost and business terms to be negotiable and will not be artificially
constrained by an Offeror's internal corporate policies. In short, Offerors that contend they lack
flexibility because of their corporate policy on a particular negotiation item will face a significant
disadvantage and may not be elevated to the final negotiation phase. After negotiations have
been conducted with each offeror so selected, the County shall select the Offeror which, in its
opinion, has made the best proposal, and shall award the contract to that Offeror.
18.9. Should the County determine in writing and in its sole discretion that only one Offeror is fully
qualified, or that one Offeror is clearly more highly qualified than the others under consideration,
a contract may be negotiated and awarded to that offeror. Each SAC will make appropriate
recommendations to the County Purchasing Agent, if appropriate, prior to the actual award of
contract.
18.10. Proposals which, after discussion and submission of additional clarification and/or
supplementary information, are determined to meet the specifications of this RFP will be
classified as "acceptable". Proposals found not to be acceptable will be classified as
"unacceptable" and no further discussion concerning same will be conducted.
18.11. The County may cancel this RFP or reject proposals at any time prior to an award and is not
required to furnish a statement of the reasons why a particular proposal was not deemed to be
the most advantageous.
