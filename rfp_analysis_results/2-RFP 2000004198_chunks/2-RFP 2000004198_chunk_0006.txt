protection from creditors in a court of law. The County shall have full rights to use

approval.

property. However, such claim to proprietary content cannot intrude on the County’s
right to access its data without undue interference or additional cost.

without the express written consent of the appropriate County representative. Data
covered under specific federal, state and local privacy laws are confidential. Any
