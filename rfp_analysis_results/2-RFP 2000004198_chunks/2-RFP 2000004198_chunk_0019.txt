the invoices and the utilization reports to the addresses identified in the final contract.
22. CHANGES:
22.1. Fairfax County may, at any time, by written order, require changes in the services to be
performed by the Contractor. If such changes cause an increase or decrease in the Contractors
cost of, or time required for, performance of any services under this contract, an equitable
adjustment shall be made, and the contract shall be modified in writing accordingly. The County
Procurement Agent must approve all work that is beyond the scope of this RFP.

furnished without the prior written authorization of the Fairfax County Procurement Agent.
23. DELAYS AND SUSPENSIONS:

in the discretion of the County Purchasing Agent is reasonably suited for completion of work.
The County may further amend the contract by mutual agreement for any increase in the cost
of performance of the contract (excluding profit) resulting solely from the delay or suspension
of the contract. No adjustment shall be made under this clause for any delay or interruption
resulting from any other cause, including the fault or negligence of the Contractor.
23.2. If the County does not direct the Contractor, in writing, to suspend, delay, or interrupt the
contract, the Contractor must give the County Purchasing Agent written notice if Fairfax County
fails to provide data or services that are required for contract completion by the Contractor.
The County may extend the Contractor's time of completion by a period of time that in the
discretion of the County Purchasing Agent is reasonably suited for completion of work. The
