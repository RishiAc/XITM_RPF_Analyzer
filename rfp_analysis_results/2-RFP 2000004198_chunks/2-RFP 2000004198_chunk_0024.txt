II, III, and IV). When such goods and services are included in the Pricing Schedule, bidders may bid on all areas or an individual
area. A map showing the areas of the County will be furnished with the solicitation when required.
12. RECEIPT OF BIDS-Bids received prior to the time of opening will be securely kept, unopened by the County. No responsibility
will attach to the Purchasing Agent or her representative for the premature opening of a bid not properly addressed and identified.
Unless specifically authorized in the solicitation, telegraphic, electronic, or facsimile bids/modifications will not be considered by
the County.
13. BID OPENING-All bids received in response to an Invitation for Bid (IFB) will be opened at the date, time and place specified,
read publicly, and made available for inspection as provided in paragraph 64, General Conditions and Instructions to Bidders.
The Purchasing Agent’s representative assigned to open the bids will decide when the specified time for bid opening has arrived.
Tabulations of bids received are posted on the County’s website at: https://www.fairfaxcounty.gov/procurement/bid-tab.
Proposals received in response to a Request for Proposal (RFP) will be made available as provided in Paragraph 63, General
Conditions and Instructions to Bidders.
14. OMISSIONS & DISCREPANCIES-Any items or parts of any equipment listed in this solicitation that clearly necessary for the
operation and completion of such equipment, but are: (i) not fully described by the County; or (ii) are omitted by the County from
such specification, shall be considered a part of such equipment even if not directly specified or called for in the specifications.
If a bidder finds discrepancies or ambiguities in, or omissions from, the solicitation, including the drawings and/or specifications,
it shall notify the Purchasing Agent at least five (5) days prior to the date set for the opening of bids. If necessary, the Purchasing
Agent will send a written addendum for clarification to all bidders no later than three (3) days before the date set for opening of
bids. Notifications regarding specifications will not be considered if received within five days of the date set for opening of bids.
15. BIDDER INTERESTED IN MORE THAN ONE BID-If more than one bid is offered by a bidder, directly or indirectly, all such bids
may be rejected. A bidder who has quoted prices on work, materials, or supplies to a bidder is not disqualified from quoting
prices to other bidders or firms submitting a bid directly for the work, materials or supplies.
16. TAX EXEMPTION-The County is exempt from the payment of any federal excise or any Virginia sales tax. Fairfax County's
Federal Excise Tax Exemption Number is 54-74-0127K.
17. PROHIBITION AGAINST UNIFORM PRICING-The Purchasing Agent encourages open and competitive bidding by all possible
means and endeavors to obtain the maximum degree of open competition on all purchase transactions using the methods of
procurement authorized by the Fairfax County Purchasing Resolution. Each bidder, by virtue of submitting a bid, guarantees
that it has not been a party with other bidders to an agreement to bid a fixed or uniform price. Violation of this implied guarantee
shall render void the bids of participating bidders. Any disclosure to or acquisition by a competitive bidder, in advance of the
opening of the bids, of the terms or conditions of the bid submitted by another competitor may render the entire proceedings void
and may require re-advertising for bids.
