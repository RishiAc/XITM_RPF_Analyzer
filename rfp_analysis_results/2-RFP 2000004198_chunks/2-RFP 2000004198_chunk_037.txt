22. CHANGES:
22.1. Fairfax County may, at any time, by written order, require changes in the services to be
performed by the Contractor. If such changes cause an increase or decrease in the Contractors
cost of, or time required for, performance of any services under this contract, an equitable
adjustment shall be made, and the contract shall be modified in writing accordingly. The County
Procurement Agent must approve all work that is beyond the scope of this RFP.
22.2. No services for which an additional cost or fee will be charged by the Contractor shall be
furnished without the prior written authorization of the Fairfax County Procurement Agent.
