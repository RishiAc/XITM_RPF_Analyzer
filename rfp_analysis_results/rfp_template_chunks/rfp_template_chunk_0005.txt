SUPPLIES OR SERVICES AND PRICES/COSTS
B.1 Contract Line Item Number (CLIN) Description
[Enter desired contract term in the first sentence (see Section F.1 note). See Section H.3 for more details
regarding the ESCO’s reserve account, the FMV determination, and title transfer of the PV System. Consult
with FEMP for assistance and updated information.]
The <agency> contemplates award of a firm-fixed-price contract for a term of <x> years. The <agency> will
only pay for kilowatt-hours of electricity delivered – all costs associated with this contract shall be reimbursed
through the $/kWh price.
Per the ESPC statute, ESPC ESA payments must come from energy savings generated each year over the life
of the contract; annual payments may not exceed the amount that the <agency> would have paid for utilities in
the absence of this ESPC ESA. The price for the electricity purchased from the PV System for the life of the
contract, < Select one of the following: with no escalation rate, escalated annually at a rate of x% or escalated
at a rate to be proposed by the Offeror>, must be less than the current and forecasted electricity price,
including transmission, distribution and all other electricity charges.
The government has estimated the PV System FMV at the end of the contract term to be $<x> based on <20%
of estimated PV System cost or other methodology>. Using this FMV estimate and PV System production
estimates shown in Exhibit 4, the government payment to the ESCO’s reserve account will initially be set to
<x>$/kWh. This amount will be added to the Offeror’s proposed ESPC ESA price to determine the total ESPC
ESA price, and for determining whether the ESPC statutory savings requirement is met.
The Contractor will furnish all planning, management, supervision, labor materials; structural, electrical and
other engineering services; equipment, materials, tools, (except as otherwise provided) necessary to design,
finance, construct and own the PV System in accordance with the requirements herein. The Contractor is
responsible for all operation & maintenance, as well as equipment repair & replacement throughout the term of
the contract.
The Contractor is also responsible for monetization of available incentives,5 <add SREC sales if applicable>,
the cost of meeting all utility interconnection requirements and <add permitting and other applicable
requirements such as National Historic Preservation Act and glare analysis>.
The ESCO bears all financial risk for non-performance, except to the extent such non-performance is
attributable to a temporary shut-down of the facility for repairs, maintenance, or capital improvements. The
contract price for electricity will not be reduced if ESCO operating costs should diminish.
All proposed prices must be in the unit indicated, submitted using the Exhibit 2 form.
