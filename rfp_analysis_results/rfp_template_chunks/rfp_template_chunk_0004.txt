including the reserve account payment, will be used to determine compliance with the ESPC statutory savings
requirement.
<Agency> agrees to allow the Contractor access to the PV systems on its <roofs, parking lots and/or land> in
accordance with <site access terms and conditions in Section H.11 of the RFP, using FAR 52.241-5, or site
access agreement (license/easement/lease) attached as Exhibit 5.> [Add if there is a separate site access
agreement.] <The site access agreement will be fully incorporated into the Contract and is aligned with the
terms and conditions of the Contract.>
4 The ESPC ESA financing mechanism allows an ESCO to use a reserve account (i.e., a private account
independently held by the ESCO, not an escrow account by both parties to the contract) in which a portion of an
agency's annual payments from energy savings are set aside for title transfer of the onsite energy generation asset by
the conclusion of the contract. This is an accounting measure for the ESCO. The funds in the account belong to the
ESCO, not to the Federal Government.

A.1 Definitions
[NOTE: This template includes definitions that are specific to energy projects and ESPC ESAs in particular;
this list is not exhaustive, add other definitions as necessary.]
In addition to other terms specifically defined elsewhere in this solicitation, the following words and phrases
shall be defined as follows:
“Contract” means the mutual binding legal relationship, resulting from this solicitation, including Sections
A-K of the Request for Proposal, any Amendments, the Schedules and Exhibits attached hereto and the
Contractor’s price proposal in response to the solicitation.
“Contractor” means the individual or entity that is awarded the Contract resulting from the
solicitation. The terms “ESCO” and “Contractor” are used interchangeably.
“Construction Phase” means the period commencing upon receipt by the Contractor of a Notice to Proceed
from the Government and ending at PV project acceptance by <agency>.
“Energy Conservation Measure (ECM)” means a measure that is applied to an existing federal building or
facility that improves energy efficiency, is life cycle cost effective under 10 CFR Part 436, Subpart A, and
involves energy conservation, cogeneration facilities, renewable energy sources, improvements in
operation and maintenance efficiencies, or retrofit activities, which result in energy, water, or related cost
savings. For purposes of this definition, “improves energy efficiency” is not limited to a more efficient
conversion of energy; rather when renewable energy is substituted for conventional energy fuels, resulting
in the Government’s reduced usage of conventional energy sources; such a substitution constitutes
“improved energy efficiency.”
“Electric Distribution Company (EDC)” means the company providing electric distribution
services to the <agency>.
“Energy Sales Phase” means the period beginning after final PV project acceptance by <agency>.
“Energy Savings Performance Contract Energy Sales Agreement (ESPC ESA)” means the contractual
arrangement entered into pursuant to the authority under 42 U.S.C. §8287, et seq., in which the selected
Contractor installs, maintains, and operates PV Systems on-site at <agency site name> until the end of the
contract term, and in which the <agency name> purchases the PV System’s electric output from the
selected Contractor for the life of the contract.
“Energy Service Company (ESCO)” refers to the selected Contractor. The terms “ESCO” and
“Contractor” are used interchangeably.
“Fair Market Value” means, with respect to any tangible asset or service, the price that would be
negotiated in an arm’s length, free market transaction, for cash, between an informed, willing seller and an
informed, willing buyer. Fair Market Value of the PV system will be determined pursuant to Section H.3.
“MW” means megawatt. A megawatt is a unit for measuring power that is equivalent to one million
watts (equivalent to one joule per second).

“Party” or “Parties” means either Contractor or the Government or the Contractor and the Government,
respectively.
“Premises” means the real property assets listed in <Section # and/or Exhibit #>.
“PV System” means the integrated assembly of PV components, including but not limited to PV modules,
mounting assemblies, ballast weights, inverters, metering, transformers, disconnects, combiners,
switches, wiring devices, conduit, wiring and any other equipment or appurtenance necessary to be
installed at the Premises to make the PV system complete and operational, owned by the Contractor, and
interconnected with EDC, to provide electricity to the identified buildings. [This definition could be
expanded to include required electrical upgrades and/or other infrastructure such as fences if deemed
beneficial.]
“PV System Acceptance” means the official letter from <agency> to the Contractor stating that an
individual PV System has been accepted and is ready for operation.
“Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs)” represent all of the environmental and other attributes of energy
generated from renewable sources that are sold separately from the underlying electricity. They are also
referred to as renewable energy credits, green certificates, green tags, or tradable renewable certificates.
The RECs must include all of the greenhouse gas and other emissions/attributes associated with the
renewable resource, including those emissions associated with the displacement of conventional energy
generation (as legally applicable), with no emissions or attributes being disaggregated and sold separately.
“Solar RECs (SRECs)” means solar renewable energy certificates.
Interpretation. The captions or headings are strictly for convenience and shall not be considered in interpreting
this Contract. Words that import the singular connotation shall be interpreted as plural, and words that import
the plural connotation shall be interpreted as singular, as the identity of the parties or objects referred to may
require. The words “include”, “includes”, and “including” mean include, includes, and including “without
