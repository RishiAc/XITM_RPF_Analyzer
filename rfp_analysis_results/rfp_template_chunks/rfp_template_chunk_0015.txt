3) Identify how the Contractor will bring the PV System back into service expeditiously following any
such force majeure event.
4) Identify any intent to rely on the Federal Emergency Management Agency or other government relief

5) Identify catastrophic insurance, if applicable, that will be purchased for this contract.
6) Define procedures for responding to all service interruptions caused by the utility, system operator or

procedures should cover the following items:
a) Discussion of the expected causes of service interruption and how each would be handled by the
Contractor.
