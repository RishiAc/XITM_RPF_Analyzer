RFP Template
[Throughout this template, fill-in-the-blank areas are indicated with the symbols <> and notes are indicated
by [ ]. Footnotes provide additional background information.
Disclaimer: This template is intended to be used as a resource. Agency staff should adhere to their agency’s
policies and requirements, and should use their agency’s templates and forms, as appropriate. The RFP
should be carefully reviewed by agency counsel, agency contracting staff and other appropriate agency staff.
This is not a complete RFP. It does not include Sections C, E, and M, which are a required part of a complete
RFP. Sections C and E are covered in the “Procurement Specifications Templates for Onsite Solar
Photovoltaic: For Use in Developing Federal Solicitations” (see
https://energy.gov/eere/femp/downloads/procurement-specifications-templates-site-solar-photovoltaic-use-
developing). Section M will be added to a future version of this document.
This RFP assumes that FAR Part 12 Commercial Items is utilized. Agency contracting and legal staff should
determine if this is appropriate. The clauses, especially the Davis Bacon Act and The Service Contract Act
clauses, should be carefully reviewed to ensure that there is no conflict between FAR Parts . The RFP should
be modified accordingly if an agency decides not to use FAR Part 12.
To solicit and award an ESPC without a multiple award contract, a contracting officer should refer to the
procedures, selection method, and terms and conditions provided in 42 USC § 8287 and FAR 23.205(c) Solicit
and Award.
A Notice of Intent to Award (NOITA) step could be added before contract award. This would allow the
government to ensure that the energy service company (ESCO, also referred to as the Contractor in this RFP)
has everything in order for a successful project; including project financing, evidence of bonds/insurance, a
signed interconnection agreement and/or other criteria.
There may be some provisions in the RFP that should be moved to the site access agreement.
Contracting/legal staff should coordinate with real property staff to determine the appropriate document for
the relevant clauses. Clause duplication should be avoided to prevent language conflicts that may occur due to
