DELIVERIES OR PERFORMANCE
F.1 Term of Contract
[The total ESPC ESA contract length must not exceed 20 years in order to meet the IRS Revenue Procedure
2017-19 ESPC ESA safe harbor requirements6. An initial contract term of less than 20 years may be beneficial
so that the contract can be extended if the estimated PV System FMV increases significantly during the
contract term. This will provide additional time for the required ESCO’s reserve account funds to be
accumulated. The alternative is to increase the government’s payments that are to be allocated to the ESCO’s
reserve account. This will only be allowed if the statutory savings requirement is still met and may require a
more extensive contract modification.]
The ESPC ESA contract term will begin upon contract award and continue for <x> years, unless terminated
earlier pursuant to the provisions of this contract.
F.2 Place of Performance
The place of performance for this contract is the following:
<List of PV System(s) location and type (rooftop, carport, ground-mount)>
F.3 Notice to Proceed (NTP)
Both the design and construction phases of the contract will begin upon receiving a written NTP from
<agency>. The Contractor may proceed with design after receiving an official design NTP letter from
<agency>. The NTP will be provided no later than <x> days after contract award. The PV System design
shall be submitted within <x> days of the design NTP letter date. The <agency> will review the design and
provide feedback within <x> days.
Construction NTP will be granted when the following conditions have been met: all final design approvals are
received; the final stamped designs are received; all other construction documents including a construction
plan and schedule (see Section 0) have been reviewed and approved by <agency>; and proof of insurance and
bonds has been received. Limited construction NTP, in advance of the official construction NTP, may be
granted upon request for purposes of ordering equipment with long lead-time. Limited construction NTP will
only be granted by <agency> after review of the equipment specs to ensure that they meet all contract
requirements.
F.4 Contract Performance Deliverables
Construction and acceptance of the PV System shall be completed by <date>. The Contractor will not be held
responsible for <agency> or other Government delays. In case of delays that are not the fault of the
Contractor, a new completion date shall be proposed by the Contractor, for approval by the <agency>.
6 As stated in Section A, tax incentive eligibility due diligence is the responsibility of the ESCO, not the
government.
