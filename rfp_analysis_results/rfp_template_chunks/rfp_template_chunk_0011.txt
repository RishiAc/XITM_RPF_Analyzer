requirements associated with the ESCO’s reserve account. The ESCO could be required to obtain an FMV
appraisal right after contract award so that the government’s estimated FMV and the resulting reserve
account payment can be confirmed. Consult with FEMP for assistance and updated information.]
Title to the PV System shall be transferred to <Agency> for FMV, determined by the methodology specified in
Section H.3.2, by the end of the contract and funds necessary for this purchase must be generated from a
specified portion of the scheduled payments that are transferred to a reserve account held by the ESCO.
H.3.1 ESCO’s Reserve Account
Each <specify frequency – monthly, each year or other> the ESCO will transfer a specified portion of the
payments it receives from the <agency> into a reserve account held by the ESCO. The ESCO’s deposit into
the ESCO’s reserve account shall be < x> $/kWh as specified in Section B.1.
[Modify the following paragraph based on the desired FMV re-appraisal intervals, the selection criteria for
the entity that will conduct the appraisals and the associated credentials, and who will be responsible for the
appraisal costs. Hiring one company to conduct all the appraisals may reduce costs, since subsequent
appraisals should just involve an update to the initial appraisal.]
An updated FMV appraisal shall be made at the following intervals <list desired intervals such as years 5, 10
and 15>. If needed, the contract length7 and/or <agency’s> payment to be allocated to the ESCO’s reserve
account shall be increased or decreased, through a contract modification. This will ensure that the ESCO’s
reserve account has sufficient funds to reach the FMV of the PV System before title transfer to the <agency>.
The <agency> may require additional FMV appraisals if the differential between the prior FMV appraisal and
the current FMV appraisal is greater than 25%.
The appraiser8 shall be selected by the ESCO, with approval by the <agency>. The FMV appraisal costs shall
be borne by the ESCO.
H.3.1.1 ESCO Reserve Account Fund Uses and Management
[This section contains optional sample language regarding the management and use of the reserve account
funds. The CO may include a clause requiring CO approval of all reserve account fund expenditures.]
The ESCO’s reserve account funds are intended for the following uses only: FMV purchase, applied by the
ESCO to final ESPC payments, a contract modification (i.e. additional equipment) and/or termination liability.
In the case of termination, disbursement from the ESCO’s reserve account fund shall be negotiated through the
termination settlement process, in accordance with FAR 52.249-2.
7 The contract length can only be extended up to 20 years.
8 Add Appraiser requirements. Possible language: “A nationally recognized, independent third-party Accredited
Senior Appraiser with a specialty in machinery and equipment appraisal techniques applied to solar photovoltaic
property. <Agency> shall be a named Intended User in the appraisal assignment, and shall be granted access to the
complete work file supporting the appraisal.”

An annual reserve account statement, including documentation of all reserve account activity during the year,
shall be included in the annual M&V report. All costs of administering the ESCO’s reserve account shall be
borne by the ESCO, rather than being taken out of the reserve account funds.
Any funds in the ESCO reserve account in excess of the PV System FMV may, at the ESCO’s option, be
applied by the ESCO to offset the final ESPC payment(s). The reserve account balance shall be zero by the
end of the contract.
H.3.2 Determination of Final FMV
At least six months prior to the end of the contract the final PV System FMV appraisal shall be made. This
value will be determined by an appraiser9. Such appraiser shall act reasonably and in good faith to
determine the PV System FMV and shall set forth such determination in a written opinion delivered to the
Parties. The valuation made by the appraiser shall be binding upon the Parties in the absence of fraud or
