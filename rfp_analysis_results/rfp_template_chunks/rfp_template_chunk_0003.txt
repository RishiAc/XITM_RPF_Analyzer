submitted). An agency ESCO qualified list consistent with 42 U.S.C. § 8287(b)(2)(A)-(B) requirements can be
referenced instead of the DOE Qualified List.].
In order for the ESPC ESA contract to be scored annually, it must be consistent with the requirements under
the OMB “Addendum to OMB Memorandum M-98-13 on Federal Use of Energy Savings Performance
Contracts (ESPCs) and Utility Energy Service Contracts (UESCs)” (M-12-21, dated September 28, 2012),
including the requirement that the federal government retain title to the onsite renewable energy generation
system at the conclusion of the contract.
The ESCO may be eligible for tax incentives such as the federal Investment Tax Credit (ITC) and the Modified
Accelerated Cost Recovery System (MACRS). Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Revenue Procedure 2017-19
(see https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-irbs/irb17-07.pdf) provides a safe harbor (related to ITC eligibility) under
which the IRS will not challenge the treatment of an ESPC ESA as a service contract under 26 U.S.C. §
7701(e)(3). Section 4 specifies the following requirements that must be met to qualify for this safe harbor:
“(1) Term. The total term of the ESPC ESA cannot exceed 20 years in length. The term must be
consistent with and appropriate for the scope and scale of the renewable project.
(2) Other Federal guidance. The ESPC ESA must satisfy the requirements of 42 U.S.C § 8287 and
OMB Memorandum M-12-21.
(3) Operation of Alternative Energy Facility. Under no circumstances will the FA3 attempt to operate
the renewable energy generation asset. In the event of a shut-down or mechanical issue, FA will
immediately notify the ESCO or its designated contractor.
(4) Risk. The ESCO bears all financial risk for non-performance, except to the extent such non-
performance is attributable to a temporary shut-down of the facility for repairs, maintenance, or
capital improvements.
(5) Reduced Costs. The contract price for electricity will not be reduced if operating costs should
diminish.
(6) Equipment Purchase. The FA may have the option to purchase, or may be required to purchase,
the renewable energy generation asset at the end of the contract term, for its fair market value (FMV)
at the time of the purchase.”

Tax incentive eligibility due diligence is the responsibility of the ESCO, not the government. The ESPC ESA
price will not be modified if the IRS determines that the ESCO is not eligible for the tax incentives and the
ESCO has no other recourse against the <agency>.
The ESCO will transfer a portion of the payments it receives from <agency> each year into a reserve account
held by the ESCO.4 The <agency> satisfies the obligation to take title to the PV System by the end of the
contract through its annual payments over the course of the contract (and through any adjustments to the
payments resulting from the ESCO's periodic reappraisals of the PV System FMV to ensure that the ESCO’s
reserve account has sufficient funds by the point at which title is transferred).
See Sections B.1 and H.3 for reserve account and FMV determination details. The total ESPC ESA price,
