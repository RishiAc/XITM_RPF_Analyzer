SPECIAL CONTRACT REQUIREMENTS
[Reference the DOE IDIQ contract Section H for other potentially relevant clauses.]
H.1 Special Purpose Entities and Novation
[Agency may specify that the Contractor must select financing through a competitive selection process
involving a minimum of three reputable finance companies.]
The <agency> recognizes that securing financing may involve the establishment of a limited liability
company (LLC) or other type of special purpose entity (SPE). Creation of an SPE under an ESPC ESA
requires the execution of a novation agreement by the agency CO and prime contractor to recognize a
successor in interest to the agency contract when contractor assets are transferred.
The ESPC statutory authority provides that an agency may enter into an ESPC with an ESCO that is on a
qualified list established pursuant to the requirements under 42 U.S.C. § 8287(b)(2)(A). The initial award of
an ESPC ESA to a qualified list ESCO satisfies this requirement, even though the newly created SPE may not
be on an established qualified list.
Any subsequent agreement that is executed to novate the contract to a SPE must be approved by the
responsible contracting officer and must be consistent with all applicable statutory and regulatory
requirements. Specifically, the requirement that the transferor (ESCO) guarantees performance of the contract
by the transferee (SPE) must be met. See FAR 42.1204(h)(3). Novation agreement approval is at the
<agency’s> sole discretion pending a determination by the CO that the SPE is capable of meeting all contract
requirements and obtaining financing.
The planned use of an LLC or other type of SPE should be identified in the proposal as part of the Preliminary
Project Finance Plan (see Section H.16).
[If this agreement is novated, a novation may also be required for the site access agreement.]
H.2 Title to the PV System
Until such time as the <agency> accepts title to the PV System, the ESCO shall be the legal and beneficial
owner of the PV System. During this time, the system shall be the personal property of the ESCO as defined
under Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code and shall not be deemed as part of, or fixture to, the
Premises. The <agency> covenants that it will use reasonable commercial efforts to place all parties having an
interest in the ESCO’s property located on the Premises on notice of the ownership of the PV System and the
legal status or classification of the PV System as personal property. The <agency> is the owner of the
Premises and consents to the filing of a disclaimer of the PV System as a fixture of the Premises in the office
where real estate records are customarily filed in the jurisdiction of the Premises until such time that the
<agency> accepts title to the PV System.
As specified in Section H.3, <agency> shall accept title to the PV System from the ESCO by the end of the
contract term.
