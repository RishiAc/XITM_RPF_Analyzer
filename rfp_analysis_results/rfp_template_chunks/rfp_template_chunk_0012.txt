manifest error. The cost of the appraisal shall be borne by the ESCO.

<agency> shall ensure that there will be sufficient funds by the end of the contract by one or more of the
following:
1) Increase reserve account payment.
2) Increase the contract length.

A contract modification may be required.

By the end of the contract, the <agency> shall accept title to the PV System from the ESCO at FMV, as
determined per Section H.3.2, using the funds in the ESCO’s reserve account.

system to pass to the <agency>, free and clear of any encumbrances and (B) assign all warranties for the PV
panels and other PV System equipment to the <agency>.
H.4 Congressional Notification
[Modify this section based on FAR 17.108 provisions that apply to your agency and any other agency-specific
policies. FEMP congressional notification information is available at
http://energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2014/07/f17/espc_congressional_notification.pdf]
FAR 17.108 requires agencies to notify Congress at least 30 days prior to the award of certain proposed
multiyear contracts. Congressional notification will be required for this contract if the cancellation ceiling
exceeds <$135.5 million for DoD, NASA and Coast Guard; $13.5 million for other agencies, or other
amount based on current FAR/agency policies>.
9 Add Appraiser requirements that are the same or more stringent than the initial appraisal requirements.

The contract may then be awarded only after the end of the 30-day period beginning on the date the
notification is received by Congress.
H.5 Disposition of Solar Renewable Energy Certificate (SRECs)
[Agency should decide whether they want to purchase the project SRECs based on the applicable SREC
market price. The Contractor could be required to purchase replacement RECs or the agency should plan to
purchase replacement RECs, if needed for compliance with the current RE goal. It may be beneficial for an
agency to purchase the SRECs in the latter years of the contract when the SREC value will likely be low or
zero. Contact FEMP for assistance in developing appropriate RFP language.]
[If the agency would like the Contractor to sell the SRECs and reduce the ESPC ESA price:]
The Government’s purchase of energy from the PV Systems excludes any associated SRECs. The Contractor
is free to sell the SRECs <and shall purchase replacement RECs on behalf of the agency or agency will
purchase replacement RECs>. The Contractor is responsible for fulfilling all requirements necessary for the
SREC sale. It is anticipated that SREC proceeds may allow the Contractor to proposal the <agency> a lower
ESPC ESA price.
[If the agency would like to purchase the SRECs with the electricity:]
The SRECs shall be <transferred to the agency or retired on the agency’s behalf in one of the REC tracking
systems10>.
